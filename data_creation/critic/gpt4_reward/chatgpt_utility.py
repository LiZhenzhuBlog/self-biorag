        "Perceived utility: 2\n"
        "Explanation: While the output provides a factually correct statement about the UK prime minister from 2019 to 2022, this instruction asks who the prime minister is as of 2023, so it doesn't answer the instruction. Therefore, the utility is 2.\n\n"

        "Output: 'Tokyo is a vibrant city full of exciting tourist attractions. Some must-see sights include the Tokyo Skytree, Tokyo Disneyland, Sensoji Temple, Meiji Shrine, Tsukiji Fish Market, Harajuku, and Shinjuku Gyoen.\n"
        "Perceived utility: 3\n"

        "##\n Instruction: Generate a description of the structure and mechanism of action of the enzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase.\n"
        "Output: NADPH oxidase is a membrane-bound enzyme that plays an important role in the production of reactive oxygen species. It is composed of six distinct subunits and is found in both the cytosol and the membrane. The subunits are composed of two copies each of the cytosolic subunits: p47 phox, p67 phox, p40 phox, and two copies of the membrane-associated subunits: gp91phox and p22phox. NADPH oxidase functions by donating electrons to the active site of the enzyme, thus allowing it to reduce oxygen molecules to form superoxide anion (O2âˆ’). The end product of this reaction is the reactive oxygen species, which is used to fight infection or for other body functions. NADPH oxidase is regulated by various signals such as calcium, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), and calcium binding proteins. In addition, it is inhibited by certain compounds, such as apocynin, that prevent its activation. NADPH oxidase plays an important role in the body's defenses against infection, and it is thus essential for many biological processes.\n"
        "Perceived utility: 5\n"
        "Explanation: This response provides a descriptive explanation of the structure and function of NADPH oxidase, giving full and comprehensive information. Thus, this is deemed a high utility response satisfying the user's information needs.\n\n"
        "##\n Instruction: Was the enhancement of Lck activity immediate?\n"
        "Output: No, the enhancement of Lck activity did not have an immediate relevance to TCR-mediated signal transduction, as judged from the lack of detectable de novo phosphorylation of zeta-chain and the absence of functional responses of T cells.\n"
        "Perceived utility: 3\n"
        "Explanation: The response robustly addresses the aspect of Lck activity enhancement not being immediate. However, the details provided thereafter are quite dense and technical, and without proper context, they may not be easy to interpret for all readers. Simplifying this information or providing some additional context could improve the perceived utility.\n\n"
        "##\n Instruction: Alcohol intake during pregnancy causes, all, except?\n"
        "Output: Brachycephaly\n"
        "Perceived utility: 5\n"
        "Explanation: This is a concise and correct answer to the posed question, focusing on the exclusion of one potential effect of alcohol intake during pregnancy. The response specifically points out that brachycephaly is not caused by alcohol intake during pregnancy, thus correctly answering the query. There's not much room for more elaborate discussion in this case, making this answer complete and highly useful for the user's information needs in this context.\n\n"
