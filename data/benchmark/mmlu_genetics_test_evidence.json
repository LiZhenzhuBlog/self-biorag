It also has two zinc finger motif regions and two ATP binding sites. To study the potential roles of both helix-turn-helix and zinc finger motifs in the functioning of UvrA protein, random mutations were created in these motif regions by degenerate oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis. Using this method, 12 single substitution mutants (eight in the helix-turn-helix motif region, one in the N-terminal zinc finger region, and three in the C-terminal zinc finger region) were isolated that failed to confer UV resistance in the E. coli strain deleted of the uvrA gene. One \"hyper\" UV-resistant mutant, G275A, was identified that conferred significantly more UV resistance than the wild type in the MH1-delta A strain. To further investigate the mechanism of failure of these mutant UvrA proteins to support nucleotide excision repair, two mutant UvrA proteins, G502D and V508D, were selected for purification and characterization, since they carry mutations at the positions offered as the putative constellation for the helix-turn-helix motif. The binding affinity of these two mutants for nonirradiated plasmid DNA was unaffected by the mutations. Both mutant proteins exhibited substantial ATPase activity, and together with the UvrB protein, they were capable of generating positively supercoiled plasmid DNA from the relaxed form in the presence of ATP and bacterial topoisomerase I. However, both mutant proteins failed to respond to UV damage in the filter binding assay and were incapable of forming 2 x SSC-resistant nucleoprotein complexes with UvrB protein on UV-irradiated plasmid DNA. Taking these properties together, it appears that the mutations in the helix-turn-helix motif region impaired the UvrA protein's ability to recognize UV damage, while its other activities were largely unaffected.

Similarly, if a respondent switch to option B in between row 6 to row 9, we declared them as risk-averse respondent.

In self-compatible plants, low-frequency alleles are usually found in a heterozygous state, meaning recessive traits are usually hidden by dominant alleles unless present at a relatively high frequency in the population.

Thus, there are a total of four analysis options, referred to as PPIs, PPIs, proteins and partners. These options address different types of questions about a network. The most common questions may deal with network PPIs—for example, in which tissues do the PPIs occur? This is best addressed by the PPIs option, which would report numbers of PPIs in each tissue, and their significance. Another PPI-related question might be, which drugs have the biggest impact on the network? Here, the best option may be PPIs; for each drug, it would report the number and significance of potentially affected PPIs (i.e. PPIs involving at least one of the drug's targets). The proteins option is best for most questions that do not specifically focus on PPIs—for example, which diseases are prevalent in the network? The proteins option would report the frequency and significance of each disease among network proteins. The PPIs and PPIs options may give unintuitive results for such questions. For example, if a disease is annotated to many proteins, but these proteins do not interact with each other, then PPIs would report the disease's frequency as zero. Conversely, if a disease is annotated to a single protein, but the protein has a high degree, then, PPIs would report a high disease frequency.

Strategies are needed to improve the uptake of these guidelines to prevent avoidable new HIV infections of infants. In 2010 the World Health Organisation presented its new PMTCT guidelines, offering two options for short courses of antiretroviral prophylaxis: Option A and Option B. Option A consists of antenatal prophylaxis with zidovudine followed by intrapartum and postpartum prophylaxis with single-dose nevirapine and zidovudine plus lamivudine. Option B recommends triple antiretroviral prophylaxis until after finishing breastfeeding. Tanzania has adopted Option A, and it is currently implementing it. A new option termed Option B+ has emerged recently, which recommends providing lifelong antiretroviral treatment to all HIV-positive pregnant women. In this article, we discuss the likely impact of this last PMTCT strategy in rural Africa with an example of an observational cross-sectional analysis in a rural referral hospital in Tanzania aiming to assess the uptake of PMTCT recommendations. Gaps were identified at all steps of the PMTCT pathway. Effective uptake of PMTCT guidelines has been shown to be extremely challenging in this setting. The continuously changing recommendations on PMTCT stress the need for a much simpler and effective approach. We argue in favour of implementing Option B+ in Tanzania.

Two scenarios could explain this pattern: 1) Co-option of LTR retrotransposon genes does occur at an extremely low frequency; and 2) co-option of LTR retrotransposon genes occurs frequently, but co-opted genes are frequently lost. In our previous study of retrovirus gene co-option, we also observed a similar pattern: retrovirus gene co-option is relatively rare in the deep branches of vertebrates, which is likely due to frequent co-option and frequent loss. We think the paucity of LTR retrotransposon gag gene co-option during the deep evolution of eukaryotes could be explained by frequent co-option and frequent loss, and mining co-option events within the level of taxonomic family would help confirm this hypothesis. Our analyses came with several caveats: 1) We only mined annotated proteomes of eukaryotes, and many retrotransposon-related genes might not be well annotated. Thus, the number of co-opted LTR retrotransposon gag genes are underestimated in this study. 2) We only sampled ∼740 eukaryote families. It is possible that many co-option events occurred recently, and these relatively recent co-option events might not be unearthed in this study. 3) Our data set is biased to animals, fungi, and plants, as most genome sequencing has been performed in these groups, which might result in underestimation of LTR co-option in protists. However, our study well covers the deep diversity of eukaryotes, and covers the major diversity of animals, plants, and fungi.

This situation arises when tags cannot be mapped to certain regions in the genome, which contain repetitive elements. Since a read aligning to a repetitive element cannot be mapped to a unique genomic location, such tags are usually left out from further consideration, and as a result certain genomic regions enriched with repetitive elements are left unmapped. SISSRs employs a simple procedure to identify those binding sites with tags mapped just to one side of the site (see Methods section). Based on our analysis with the many transcription factor binding proteins, we found that an additional ∼1–2% of binding sites could be identified by selecting this option (this option was not used to identify sites reported in this study). SISSRs also provides an option to mask out reads that fall within certain regions in the genome. This is useful especially if one needs to ignore tags that fall within, say, satellite repeat regions or regions close to centromere. Since such regions are suspected to contain disproportionately large number of mapped reads, which could be due to amplification biases or incorrect mapping of reads with one or two mismatches to regions having high sequence similarity with repetitive regions that are usually masked out during mapping, it is sometimes necessary to ignore reads mapped to these regions.", "pmid": "18684996", "journal_title": "N/A", "PubDate_year": null, "PubDate_month": null, "PubDate_date": null}, {"rank": 5, "score": 70.823326, "title": "Hair camouflage: A comprehensive review", "text": "An option for patients with hair thinning but not severe hair loss is integration wigs.

Among these stages, prenatal epigenetic registration is the most eminent and profound influence on the formation or fine-tuning of the nervous system during development.” We consider that the starting point in clinical work should consider prenatal maternal stress which can be seen as a contributing factor to stress conduct later in life.

Recent studies demonstrate that gene-by-environment interactions involve both chromatin states and transcriptional regulation, and that epigenetics provides important mechanistic clues to connect expression-related quantitative trait loci (QTL) and disease outcomes.

The field of psychiatry is constantly challenged to bring new approaches and tools to address and treat the needs of vulnerable individuals and subpopulations, and that has to be supported by a continuous growth in knowledge. The majority of neuropsychiatric symptoms reflect complex gene-environment interactions, with epigenetics bridging the gap between genetic susceptibility and environmental stressors that trigger disease onset and drive the advancement of symptoms. It has more recently been demonstrated in preclinical models that epigenetics underpins the transgenerational inheritance of stress-related behavioural phenotypes in both paternal and maternal lineages, providing further supporting evidence for heritability in humans. However, unbiased prospective studies of this nature are practically impossible to conduct in humans so preclinical models remain our best option for researching the molecular pathophysiologies underlying many neuropsychiatric conditions. While rodents will remain the dominant model system for preclinical studies (especially for addressing complex behavioural phenotypes), there is scope to expand current research of the molecular and epigenetic pathologies by using invertebrate models. Here, we will discuss the utility and advantages of two alternative model organisms–Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster–and summarise the compelling insights of the epigenetic regulation of transgenerational inheritance that are potentially relevant to human psychiatry.

Obesity is associated with extensive gene expression changes in tissues throughout the body. Epigenetics is emerging as perhaps the most important mechanism through which the lifestyle-choices we make can directly influence the genome. Considerable epidemiological, experimental and clinical data have been amassed showing that the risk of developing disease in later life is dependent on early life conditions, mainly operating within the normative range of developmental exposures. In addition to the 'maternal' interactions, there has been increasing interest in the epigenetic mechanisms through which 'paternal' influences on offspring development can be achieved. Nutrition, among many other environmental factors, is a key player that can induce epigenetic changes not only in the directly exposed organisms but also in subsequent generations through the transgenerational inheritance of epigenetic traits. Overall, significant progress has been made in the field of epigenetics and obesity and the first potential epigenetic markers for obesity that could be detected at birth have been identified. Fortunately, epigenetic phenomena are dynamic and rather quickly reversible with intensive lifestyle changes. This is a very promising and sustainable resolution to the obesity pandemic.

Two scenarios could explain this pattern: 1) Co-option of LTR retrotransposon genes does occur at an extremely low frequency; and 2) co-option of LTR retrotransposon genes occurs frequently, but co-opted genes are frequently lost. In our previous study of retrovirus gene co-option, we also observed a similar pattern: retrovirus gene co-option is relatively rare in the deep branches of vertebrates, which is likely due to frequent co-option and frequent loss. We think the paucity of LTR retrotransposon gag gene co-option during the deep evolution of eukaryotes could be explained by frequent co-option and frequent loss, and mining co-option events within the level of taxonomic family would help confirm this hypothesis. Our analyses came with several caveats: 1) We only mined annotated proteomes of eukaryotes, and many retrotransposon-related genes might not be well annotated. Thus, the number of co-opted LTR retrotransposon gag genes are underestimated in this study. 2) We only sampled ∼740 eukaryote families. It is possible that many co-option events occurred recently, and these relatively recent co-option events might not be unearthed in this study. 3) Our data set is biased to animals, fungi, and plants, as most genome sequencing has been performed in these groups, which might result in underestimation of LTR co-option in protists. However, our study well covers the deep diversity of eukaryotes, and covers the major diversity of animals, plants, and fungi. If a co-option event occurred in deep past and the co-opted gene pass on to its descendants, and if the co-opted gene has been annotated in some of the descendants, our analysis could capture this event. It follows that we might not miss many co-option events occurred in deep past (especially within animals, plants, and fungi), such as the emergence of tetrapods or the emergence of angiosperms.

However, the persistent demand for commercial use led the Iwate Prefecture to breed elite gentian cultivars to provide a consistent supply of cultivated gentian plants. Thus, extensive gentian breeding and cultivation studies started in the mid-1960’s, with the first F1 cultivar ‘Iwate’ developed in 1977. Since then, more than twenty cultivars have been bred for use in Iwate Prefecture as cut flowers and potted plants from early July to early November (Table 1). Unlike rice, wheat, and soybean, Japanese gentian plants show strong inbreeding depression traits making it difficult to breed elite fixed cultivars. The population breeding strategy of mass selection was, therefore, predominantly used for the breeding of all gentian cultivars except those propagated vegetatively. Namely, F1 seeds were obtained from maternal and paternal populations with selected phenotypes to retain a certain level of heterozygosity. As vegetatively propagated cultivars are usually more expensive, F1 seed cultivars are preferable. At present, 328 Gentiana cultivars, including expired cultivars, have been registered in the Plant Variety database (Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Japan). In fact, there are likely to be more gentian cultivars because vegetative or personally bred lines are sometimes unregistered. Gentian flower colors are predominantly blue because of the accumulation of polyacylated anthocyanins, but original cultivars with specific characteristics such as pink and white flowers are also found in local areas such as Hachmantai City (old name Ashirocho), Nishiwaga-town (Waga-gun) and Koromogawa (Oshu City). Among them, Hachimantai city, which is located in the northwestern part of Iwate Prefecture, is the most popular gentian production area and has bred many interesting cultivars. For example, the cultivar ‘New Hybrid Ashiro’ was bred there using foreign species that shows light blue-colored stylish flowers suitable for floral arrangements. More recently, a red flowered gentian cultivar ‘Koibeni’, which is used as a potted plant, was also bred there using foreign species. Some wild and cultivated gentians are shown in Fig. 1. In gentians, however, variations in the color, style, and shape of the flowers are not as pronounced as in other ornamental flowers. In lisianthus (Eustoma grandiflorum, known as prairie gentian), which belongs to the family Gentianaceae like gentians, a wide variety of cultivars have been bred from a single purple wild flower, allowing consumers to select their optimal flowers. Gentian breeding is, therefore, considered to have reached a midpoint on the path to obtaining optimal breeding results.

This may be manifested in morphology, physiological state, and/or behavior. The study of phenotypic plasticity has progressed significantly over the past few decades (Pigliucci. Plasticity has been hypothesized to act as an important strategy for organisms to cope with environmental variation (Stearns; Scheiner, and a plastic response to a changing environment might be adaptive in that individuals displaying such a response have higher fitness than those that do not (Price et al.. The role of phenotypic plasticity for evolution has been a hotly debated topic since West-Eberhard’s book, in which she postulated that the sequence of developmental plasticity, phenotypic accommodation and subsequently genetic accommodation, is the mechanism responsible for almost all evolutionary novelty, speciation, adaptive radiation, and macroevolution. In other words, evolution would proceed through adaptive developmental phenotypic plasticity.

However, this adaptation ability is somehow restraint to a certain point. Indeed, since Barker et al[] described the Developmental Origin of Health and Diseases (DOHaD), several original publications have pointed out that a poor fetal and postnatal settlement of gut microbiota will necessarily remodulate neuro-immuno-endocrine maturation of the gut.

In reality, most instances of phenotypic plasticity fall between these two extremes in being more or less reversible in response to more or less long‐lasting environmental effects (see Piersma & Drent,, and this is perhaps particularly true of the various timeframes observed in learning and forgetting (see Section VII) and other analogous biological phenomena (see Section I). Nevertheless, this dichotomy has been instructive in highlighting the range of timescales and degrees of reversibility in the expression of phenotypes, and the diverse influence of environments underlying different forms of plasticity. Different plasticities tend to operate over different timeframes within the same lifetime, and these can interact in their effects on phenotypic expression. For example, developmental plasticity early in life may affect subsequent levels of reversible plasticity or behavioural responsiveness (Dingemanse et al.,; Stamps & Groothuis,; Dingemanse & Wolf,, and this itself has been a precept for many studies over the years in behavioural endocrinology (Becker et al.,; Nelson & Kriegsfeld,.", "pmid": "35790067", "journal_title": "N/A", "PubDate_year": null, "PubDate_month": null, "PubDate_date": null}, {"rank": 9, "score": 84.77547, "title": "Sustainable harvest: managing plasticity for resilient crops", "text": "Biological plasticity refers to distinct or overlapping phenomena at different levels of organization, while organismal plasticity may be defined as an individual's response to environmental conditions or to biological and developmental cues.

The large genome of maize and the lack of sequence information effectively discouraged any attempt at positional cloning, as it was assumed that extremely large mapping populations would be necessary to provide sufficient resolution. Undeterred, several laboratories have demonstrated that positional cloning in maize is generally no more difficult than in rice or even Arabidopsis (DC.) Heynh. (see, e.g.,;;;.

While positional cloning is appropriate for cloning any trait that can be genetically mapped, there are situations for which a positional cloning approach may not be the best option.

Eukaryotic ribosomes consist of four ribosomal RNAs (25S, 18S, 5S, and 5.8S rRNA) bound by about 75 ribosomal proteins that are assembled into large and small ribosomal subunits (60S and 40S). The ribosomal RNAs are transcribed from the ribosomal DNA located in a specialized compartment called the nucleolus by RNA polymerase I and polymerase III.

Once inside the cell, lactose is converted into glucose, galactose, and allolactose by the action of β-galactosidase. Allolactose is the inducer of the lac operon, binding to the lac repressor and inducing a conformational change that prevents the repressor from binding to the operator region.

The genes responsible for lactose uptake and metabolism in E. coli (lacZ, Y, A coding for the lactose degrading enzyme (β-galactosidase), permease and transacetylase, respectively) are grouped in a single transcriptional unit, the lac operon. The expression of this operon is regulated by the LacI repressor protein, which inhibits transcription from the Plac promoter. This inhibition is relieved by inducers such as allolactose or non-metabolizable lactose analogues, such as thiomethyl-β-galactoside (TMG). Early work from showed that when a clonal population of E. coli is treated with an intermediate concentration of TMG, two stable subpopulations emerge, with cells expressing β-galactosidase either at a maximal or a negligible rate. This bistable behavior has been extensively studied both experimentally and theoretically ever since (;;;. It was shown to be governed by the positive feedback loop in the network: TMG relieves the repression of the LacY permease, which in turn allows further TMG uptake. It is generally hypothesized that, under these conditions, the lactose operon expression state is determined by stochastic fluctuations of protein expression (;.

This test could be useful for community-based screening to identify carriers of mutations in HEXA, β-globin, and CFTR that cause Tay-Sachs, sickle-cell anemia, and cystic fibrosis in Ashkenazi, African American, or Caucasian populations, respectively. Identification of carrier status would allow prospective couples to consider options such as remaining childfree, adopting, or undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) with preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD).

For example, in Guangxi, the birth rate of severe thalassemia patient dropped from 2.47‰ in year 2009 to 0.6‰ in year 2017, a 80% reduction in less than 10 years as a result of the population level extensive carrier screening effort.

The Ashkenazi Jewish population is at increased risk for several recessively inherited disorders (Tay-Sachs disease, Cystic fibrosis, Canavan disease, Gaucher disease, Familial Dysautonomia, Niemann-Pick disease, Fanconi anemia, and Bloom syndrome). Unlike Tay-Sachs disease, there is no simple biochemical or enzymatic test to detect carriers for these other disorders. However, with the rapid identification of disease-causing genes in recent years, DNA-based assays are increasingly available for carrier detection. Approximately 5% of the world's population carries a mutation affecting the globin chains of the hemoglobin molecule. Among the most common of these disorders are the thalassemias. The global birth rate of affected infants is at least 2 per 1000 (in unscreened populations), with the greatest incidence in Southeast Asian, Indian, Mediterranean, and Middle Eastern ethnic groups. Carriers are detected by evaluation of red cell indices and morphology, followed by more sophisticated hematological testing and molecular analyses. The following issues need to be considered in the development of a carrier screening program: (1) test selection based on disease severity and test accuracy; (2) funding for testing and genetic counselling; (3) definition of the target population to be screened; (4) development of a public and professional education program; (5) informed consent for screening; and (6) awareness of community needs.", "pmid": "", "journal_title": "European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)", "PubDate_year": null, "PubDate_month": null, "PubDate_date": null}, {"rank": 7, "score": 67.454475, "title": "Development, Validation and Implementation of Continuous Professional Development Programmes for Community Pharmacists", "text": "The KAP questionnaire consisted of a total of 20 questions.

Two scenarios could explain this pattern: 1) Co-option of LTR retrotransposon genes does occur at an extremely low frequency; and 2) co-option of LTR retrotransposon genes occurs frequently, but co-opted genes are frequently lost. In our previous study of retrovirus gene co-option, we also observed a similar pattern: retrovirus gene co-option is relatively rare in the deep branches of vertebrates, which is likely due to frequent co-option and frequent loss. We think the paucity of LTR retrotransposon gag gene co-option during the deep evolution of eukaryotes could be explained by frequent co-option and frequent loss, and mining co-option events within the level of taxonomic family would help confirm this hypothesis. Our analyses came with several caveats: 1) We only mined annotated proteomes of eukaryotes, and many retrotransposon-related genes might not be well annotated. Thus, the number of co-opted LTR retrotransposon gag genes are underestimated in this study. 2) We only sampled ∼740 eukaryote families. It is possible that many co-option events occurred recently, and these relatively recent co-option events might not be unearthed in this study. 3) Our data set is biased to animals, fungi, and plants, as most genome sequencing has been performed in these groups, which might result in underestimation of LTR co-option in protists. However, our study well covers the deep diversity of eukaryotes, and covers the major diversity of animals, plants, and fungi. If a co-option event occurred in deep past and the co-opted gene pass on to its descendants, and if the co-opted gene has been annotated in some of the descendants, our analysis could capture this event. It follows that we might not miss many co-option events occurred in deep past (especially within animals, plants, and fungi), such as the emergence of tetrapods or the emergence of angiosperms.

We may be able to find clues for the mechanism from another type of virus that produces naturally uncapped mRNAs. Most positive-strand RNA plant viruses lack the 5′-m7G cap and/or the poly(A)-tail. Several of them lack the 5′ m7G cap structure but contain a translation-enhancing element at the 3′UTR, named m7G cap-independent translation enhancer (CITE). CITEs recruit 40S ribosomal subunits either directly via a CITE-ribosome interaction or indirectly by interacting with a translation factor (such as eIF4G and eIF4E). The 40S ribosome, which is recruited to a CITE present at the 3′UTR, may communicate with the 5′ region of the mRNA through long-range RNA-RNA interaction between the putative ‘kissing loop’. However, the kissing loop interaction was shown to be unnecessary for some CITE-mediated translations, even though the mechanism underlying the identification of the initiation codon by the 40S ribosome on the 3′UTR without kissing loop interaction remains unknown. An interesting example of poly(A)-dependent but 5′ m7G cap-independent translation related to this phenomenon was reported. The authors showed that the poly(A) tail could facilitate translation of the upstream gene even in the absence of the 5′ m7G cap structure. This indicates that the 40S ribosome recruited at the 3′UTR of an mRNA by the poly(A) tail can execute translation without assistance from the m7G cap structure. More recently, a systematic analysis of translation mediated by 40S ribosomes recruited to various parts of an mRNA was reported using in vitro and in cellulo assay systems. The authors showed that the 40S ribosomes, which were recruited to the 3′UTRs of uncapped mRNAs either by the insertion of the EMCV IRES element or by the tethering of eIF4G to MS2-binding sites, could enhance the translation of a reporter gene located upstream of the ribosome recruitment sites. Based on these observations and the findings from other biochemical and molecular biological studies, the authors proposed that the recognition of the initiation codon by a 40S ribosome recruited to an mRNA can occur via the biased stochastic collision of the 40S ribosome with the initiation codon through RNA looping of the intervening region rather than via ribosome scanning. The hypothesis of the direct recognition of the initiation codon by an mRNA-bound 40S ribosome was supported by the structural analysis of the 48S translation initiation complex, which revealed the positions of the mRNA, tRNAiMet, eIF2, and several subunits of eIF3, eIF4A and eIF4G on the 40S ribosomal subunit. Based on the structure of the 48S complex, the direct slotting of mRNAs to the 40S ribosome was proposed as a likely mechanism to form the specific configuration of the 48S translational initiation complex. The authors recognized that the slotting model is compatible with the translation of circular mRNAs as well as the initiation of mRNAs containing IRES elements. We suggest that the slotting model can be applied to translational enhancement by the poly(A) tail. To slot the translation initiation site of an mRNA to the 40S ribosome recruited on the poly(A) tail, mRNA looping should occur in a biased stochastic manner, which would be affected by the distance between the 40S ribosome-recruitment site and the initiation site, the structure of the intervening sequence, and other factors.", "pmid": "34904669", "journal_title": "N/A", "PubDate_year": null, "PubDate_month": null, "PubDate_date": null}, {"rank": 8, "score": 65.93292, "title": "Non–Small Cell Lung Cancer Patient Preferences for First-Line\nTreatment: A Discrete Choice Experiment", "text": "The experiment was designed and D-efficiency was estimated using the R routine\nDesign of Experiments.

Here, we use a phylogenomic approach to systemically unearth co-option of retrotransposon gag genes above the family level of taxonomy in 2,011 eukaryotes, namely co-option occurring during the deep evolution of eukaryotes. We identify a total of 14 independent gag gene co-option events across more than 740 eukaryote families, eight of which have not been reported previously.

Among the major achievements of evo-devo was the discovery of Hox genes and the striking extent of their conservation []. This, together with the discovery that gene composition in distant taxa is largely similar, led to the now established paradigm that the same genetic toolkit is reused throughout evolution []. This was paradoxical with the observation that there are ‘endless forms most beautiful’ in nature, but it is now established that new developmental programs can emerge largely through co-option of preexisting regulatory gene networks via changes in how they are regulated and deployed (‘old genes play new tricks’) []. These lines of research provided great insights into the construction of a genotype–phenotype map, leading to the emergence of a set of useful concepts. Among these are the optimal pleiotropy and modularity concepts. Evo-devo studies established that because of optimal pleiotropy, the gain or loss of a trait will likely proceed by the co-option of a local regulator that responds to global cues and controls a battery of effector genes, rather than a major upstream regulator or multiple downstream effectors []. However, this does not exclude the possibility that evolution may co-opt pleiotropic regulators in some contexts]. Also thanks to evo-devo studies, we now know that there is a strong modularity in the genotype–phenotype relationship such that organisms are made of sub-components that are interdependent yet can evolve as independent modules []. Although evo-devo has made tremendous contributions to our understanding of the genotype–phenotype map, we do not wish to state that everything is explained.

In terms of complementary information, a possible strategy is the integration in the analysis of the impact of genetic variants on gene expression levels, which is not considered in GWASs and standard PRSs, an approach called transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS). TWAS was showed to significantly increase power compared to GWAS, through a better detection of causal variants. A number of different methodological approaches have been developed to perform TWAS.

Despite the progress in pharmacologic treatment, long-term survival is poor especially for severe cases. Liver transplant is an alternative treatment option, providing sufficient enzymatic activity and decreasing the risk of metabolic decompensation.

Two scenarios could explain this pattern: 1) Co-option of LTR retrotransposon genes does occur at an extremely low frequency; and 2) co-option of LTR retrotransposon genes occurs frequently, but co-opted genes are frequently lost. In our previous study of retrovirus gene co-option, we also observed a similar pattern: retrovirus gene co-option is relatively rare in the deep branches of vertebrates, which is likely due to frequent co-option and frequent loss. We think the paucity of LTR retrotransposon gag gene co-option during the deep evolution of eukaryotes could be explained by frequent co-option and frequent loss, and mining co-option events within the level of taxonomic family would help confirm this hypothesis. Our analyses came with several caveats: 1) We only mined annotated proteomes of eukaryotes, and many retrotransposon-related genes might not be well annotated. Thus, the number of co-opted LTR retrotransposon gag genes are underestimated in this study. 2) We only sampled ∼740 eukaryote families. It is possible that many co-option events occurred recently, and these relatively recent co-option events might not be unearthed in this study. 3) Our data set is biased to animals, fungi, and plants, as most genome sequencing has been performed in these groups, which might result in underestimation of LTR co-option in protists. However, our study well covers the deep diversity of eukaryotes, and covers the major diversity of animals, plants, and fungi. If a co-option event occurred in deep past and the co-opted gene pass on to its descendants, and if the co-opted gene has been annotated in some of the descendants, our analysis could capture this event. It follows that we might not miss many co-option events occurred in deep past (especially within animals, plants, and fungi), such as the emergence of tetrapods or the emergence of angiosperms.

Moreover, KANK genes were further duplicated in teleosts through the bony-fish specific WGD, while only kank1 and kank4 duplicates were retained in some of the examined fish species. We also found all zebrafish kank genes, except kank1b, are primarily expressed during embryonic vascular development.

Pelvic brooding ricefishes evolved a novel “plug” tissue,, which forms inside the female gonoduct after spawning, anchors egg-attaching filaments, and enables pelvic brooders to carry eggs externally until hatching., Compared to pregnancy, i.e., internal bearing of embryos, external bearing should alleviate constraints on inflammation in the reproductive tract.

In line with our hypothesis, histological sections of the developing plug revealed signs of gonoduct injuries by egg-attaching filaments in the pelvic brooding ricefish Oryzias eversi. Tissue-specific transcriptomes showed that inflammatory signaling dominates the plug transcriptome and inflammation-induced genes controlling vital processes for plug development such as tissue growth and angiogenesis were overexpressed in the plug.

Mutations in FGFR1, FGFR2, or FGFR3, among others, are often responsible for these syndromic cases. The associated of FGFR3 mutations with craniosynostosis has been restricted to three mutations, the common p.Pro250Arg in Muenke syndrome, p.Ala391Glu in Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans, and p.Pro250Leu identified in a family with isolated craniosynostosis. Other FGFR3 mutations result in various skeletal dysplasias: achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia, and thanatophoric dysplasia. Here, we report a novel mutation in exon 8 (IIIc) of FGFR3, p.Ala334Thr, in a young boy with mild craniosynostosis. The mutation segregated with mild craniosynostosis in the family and was absent in 188 normal controls. Alanine 334 is evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates and is located at the amino terminus of the βF loop in the FGFR3c isoform. The mutation is predicted to alter the protein tertiary structure which may impair its binding to its ligand, FGF1. The identification of a mutation in these clinically heterogeneous disorders can aid recurrence risk assessments.
