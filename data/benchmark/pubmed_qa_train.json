Answer yes, no, or maybe.", "instances": {"input": "CONTEXT: Cardiac hypertrophy occurs in response to a variety of extrinsic and intrinsic stimuli that impose increased biomechanical stress. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway has previously been strongly associated with hypertrophic signaling in the heart, and with the control of cell size in multiple contexts. This pathway is tightly regulated by many factors, including a host of kinases and phosphatases that function at multiple steps in the signaling cascade. For example, the PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) tumor suppressor protein is a phosphoinositide 3-phosphatase that, by metabolizing phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns[3,4,5]P(3), PIP3), acts in direct antagonism to growth factor-stimulated PI3K. Inhibition of PTEN leads to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Another polyphoinositide phosphatase, inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase F (Inpp5f) has recently been implicated in regulation of cardiac hypertrophy. Like PTEN, this phosphatase can degrade PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3) and thus modulates the PI3K/Akt pathway.\nQUESTION: Is inpp5f a polyphosphoinositide phosphatase that regulates cardiac hypertrophic responsiveness?", "output": "yes"}, "title": "<notitle>"}

We, thus, postulated that simultaneous quantification of Oct4 and Xist transcripts in individual blastomeres at the 8-cell stage could be informative as to their subsequent fate. Testing this hypothesis, however, presented numerous technical challenges.

To better understand the role of VEGF in arterial repair, we overexpressed both VEGF and a soluble, chimeric VEGF receptor (VEGF-trap), which binds free VEGF with high affinity, in a mouse model of arterial injury.\nQUESTION: Does vascular endothelial growth factor regulate reendothelialization and neointima formation in a mouse model of arterial injury?", "output": "yes"}, "title": "<notitle>"}
