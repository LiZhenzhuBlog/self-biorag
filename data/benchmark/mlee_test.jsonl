MATERIAL AND METHODS: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were treated with cisplatin and endothelial cell migration analyzed by fluorescence and scratch-wound migration assay. MMP2 and MMP9 activity were determined by zymographic assay, and MAPK activation by Western blotting analysis. RESULTS: We demonstrated that cisplatin provoked a time- and dose-dependent decrease of HUVEC migration; this effect was clearly independent from its well known cytotoxic activity. In addition, cisplatin markedly reduced MMP2 activity in both conditioned media and cell lysates, increased p38 MAPK and JNK phosphorylation, but did not affect ERK phosphorylation. Endothelial cell migration was attenuated by treatment of cells with GM6001, a non-specific inhibitor of MMPs, or by a selective anti-MMP2 antibody. However, treatment of cells with SB202190 or SP600125, inhibitors of p38 MAPK and JNK respectively, did not affect HUVEC migration. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that cisplatin induced a reduction of endothelial cell migration through an inhibition of MMP2 activity by downstream signal transduction pathways independent of JNK and p38 MAPK activation.\n", "output": "endothelial cell migration <Localization> type 2-matrix metalloproteinase regulation <Regulation> endothelial cell migration <Localization> vascular regeneration <Development> vascular remodeling <Remodeling> cisplatin treated <Planned_process> endothelial cell migration <Localization> MAPK activation <Positive_regulation> HUVEC migration <Localization> cisplatin reduced <Negative_regulation> cisplatin increased <Positive_regulation> JNK phosphorylation <Phosphorylation> ERK phosphorylation <Phosphorylation> Endothelial cell migration <Localization> GM6001 treatment <Planned_process> SB202190 treatment <Planned_process> HUVEC migration <Localization> endothelial cell migration <Localization> MMP2 inhibition <Negative_regulation> p38 MAPK activation <Positive_regulation> cisplatin effect <Regulation> decrease <Negative_regulation> p38 MAPK phosphorylation <Phosphorylation> cisplatin increased <Positive_regulation> selective anti-MMP2 antibody attenuated <Negative_regulation> SP600125 treatment <Planned_process> reduction <Negative_regulation> JNK activation <Positive_regulation>"}, "title": "Cisplatin reduces endothelial cell migration via regulation of type 2-matrix metalloproteinase activity."}

Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) is prominently up-regulated in the host-derived vasculature of most tumors, making it an attractive candidate for antiangiogenic intervention. Yet, the net outcome of Ang-2 functions on tumor angiogenesis is believed to be contextual depending on the local cytokine milieu. Correspondingly, Ang-2 manipulatory therapies have been shown to exert protumorigenic as well as antitumorigenic effects. To clarify the role of Ang-2 for angiogenesis and tumor growth in a definite genetic experimental setting, the present study was aimed at comparatively studying the growth of different tumors in wild-type and Ang-2-deficient mice. Lewis lung carcinomas, MT-ret melanomas, and B16F10 melanomas all grew slower in Ang-2-deficient mice. Yet, tumor growth in wild-type and Ang-2-deficient mice dissociated during early stages of tumor development, whereas tumor growth rates during later stages of primary tumor progression were similar. Analysis of the intratumoral vascular architecture revealed no major differences in microvessel density and perfusion characteristics. However, diameters of intratumoral microvessels were smaller in tumors grown in Ang-2-deficient mice, and the vasculature had an altered pattern of pericyte recruitment and maturation. Ang-2-deficient tumor vessels had higher pericyte coverage indices. Recruited pericytes were desmin and NG2 positive and predominately alpha-smooth muscle actin negative, indicative of a more mature pericyte phenotype.

Among the pathways involved in pericyte recruitment during embryonic development, the contribution of platelet-derived growth factor B and sphingosine 1-phosphate is confirmed in tumour angiogenesis. The effect of angiopoietin 1 depends on the tumour model. Transforming growth factor-beta1 enhances tumour vascularization and microvessel maturation.

Here, we discuss the possibility for MMPs to contribute to pericyte recruitment at six levels: (1) direct promotion of pericyte invasion by extracellular matrix degradation; (2) stimulation of pericyte proliferation and protection against apoptosis by modification of the ECM; (3) activation of pericytes through the release of growth factor bound to the ECM; (4) transactivation of angiogenic cell surface receptor; (5) propagation of angiogenic signalling as cofactor; and (6) recruitment of bone marrow-derived stem cells.\n", "output": "tumour pericytes Targeting <Planned_process> tumour pericyte recruitment <Localization> microvasculature development <Development> pericyte recruitment <Localization> pericyte invasion <Localization> extracellular matrix degradation <Breakdown> stimulation <Positive_regulation> pericyte proliferation <Cell_proliferation> pericytes activation <Positive_regulation> bone marrow-derived stem cells recruitment <Localization> pericyte recruitment <Localization> Pericytes critical <Positive_regulation> vascular network development <Development> tumour pericytes recruitment <Localization> pericyte recruitment <Localization> Transforming growth factor-beta1 enhances <Positive_regulation> microvessel maturation <Development> Transforming growth factor-beta1 enhances <Positive_regulation> MMPs effect <Regulation> vascular remodelling <Remodeling> ECM bound <Binding> tumour angiogenesis <Blood_vessel_development> tumour angiogenesis <Blood_vessel_development> therapy <Negative_regulation> tumour vascularization <Blood_vessel_development> matrix metalloproteinases participation <Regulation> MMPs contribute <Positive_regulation>"}, "title": "Mechanisms of pericyte recruitment in tumour angiogenesis: a new role for metalloproteinases."}

Our previous studies mapped PEDF antiangiogenic and prosurvival activities to distinct epitopes. This study was aimed to determine the minimal fragment of PEDF, which maintains antiangiogenic and antitumor efficacy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We analyzed antigenicity, hydrophilicity, and charge distribution of the angioinhibitory epitope (the 34-mer) and designed three peptides covering its COOH terminus, P14, P18, and P23. We analyzed their ability to block endothelial cell chemotaxis and induce apoptosis in vitro and their antiangiogenic activity in vivo. The selected peptide was tested for the antitumor activity against mildly aggressive xenografted prostate carcinoma and highly aggressive renal cell carcinoma. To verify that P18 acts in the same manner as PEDF, we used immunohistochemistry to measure PEDF targets, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, and CD95 ligand expression in P18-treated vasculature. RESULTS: P14 and P18 blocked endothelial cell chemotaxis; P18 and P23 induced apoptosis. P18 showed the highest IC50 and blocked angiogenesis in vivo: P23 was inactive and P14 was proangiogenic. P18 increased the production of CD95 ligand and reduced the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 by the endothelial cells in vivo. In tumor studies, P18 was more effective in blocking the angiogenesis and growth of the prostate cancer than parental 34-mer; in the renal cell carcinoma, P18 strongly decreased angiogenesis and halted the progression of established tumors.

Dvorak to the study of tumor angiogenesis and stroma generation mechanisms.\n\nIn 1983, Harold Dvorak and his colleagues were the first to show that tumor cells secreted vascular permeability factor (VPF) and that a blocking antibody to VPF could prevent the edema and fluid accumulation that is characteristic of human cancers. In 1986, Dvorak went on to demonstrate that VPF was secreted by a variety of human tumor cell lines and proposed that VPF was in part responsible for the abnormal vasculature seen in human tumors. As a result, he and other investigators demonstrated that VPF was capable of stimulating endothelial cell growth and angiogenesis. These fundamental discoveries led to additional research conducted by Napoleone Ferrara and his laboratory, confirming the cloning of VPF and renaming the protein vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In 1986, Dvorak proposed that by secreting VPF, tumors induce angiogenesis by turning on the wound healing response. He noted that wounds, like tumors, secrete VPF, causing blood vessels to leak plasma fibrinogen, which stimulates blood vessel growth and provides a matrix on which they can spread. Unlike wounds, however, that turn off VPF production after healing, tumors did not turn off their VPF production and instead continued to make large amounts of VPF, allowing malignant cells to continue to induce new blood vessels and so to grow and spread. Thus, tumors behave like wounds that fail to heal. This work is again extremely significant for patients worldwide, as Dvorak's scientific research is leading his colleagues all over the world to examine how to treat a tumor through its blood supply.\n", "output": "endothelial cell growth <Cell_proliferation> blood vessel growth <Growth> VPF production <Gene_expression> VPF production <Gene_expression> VPF make <Gene_expression> stroma generation <Development> vascular permeability factor secreted <Localization> edema prevent <Negative_regulation> VPF secreted <Localization> VPF stimulating <Positive_regulation> VPF stimulating <Positive_regulation> VPF secreting <Localization> tumors induce <Positive_regulation> VPF secrete <Localization> fibrinogen leak <Localization> malignant cells grow <Cell_proliferation> malignant cells spread <Localization> tumor treat <Planned_process> turn off <Negative_regulation> tumors turn off <Negative_regulation> tumor angiogenesis <Blood_vessel_development> blood vessels induce <Development>"}, "title": "The contribution of Harold F.

Patients with other genetic blistering disorders do not have elevated collagenase or an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma, despite chronic wounding. The connection between collagen type VII deficiency, increased collagenase, and squamous cell carcinoma is not understood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Urine from 81 patients with RDEB (39 patients), junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB; 12 patients), and epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS; 30 patients), as well as unaffected family members of RDEB patients (33 patients), was tested for the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) using a sensitive radioimmunoassay. These patients included many who were enrolled in the Epidermolysis Bullosa Registry and others who were referred by their physicians. RESULTS: Fifty-one percent of patients with RDEB had elevated levels ( greater than  5000 pg/g) of urinary bFGF. In contrast, none of the patients with JEB had elevated levels of bFGF. Twenty-one percent of clinically unaffected family members had elevated levels of bFGF, and 13% of patients with EBS had elevated levels of bFGF. The frequency of elevated bFGF values among all groups was statistically significant (p = 0.002), and the levels of bFGF in RDEB patients were significantly elevated compared with those of other groups (p  less than  0.05). CONCLUSIONS: We have found that patients with RDEB have elevated levels of bFGF, which may contribute to increased fibroblast collagenase and the development of squamous cell carcinoma.

Although some recent reports suggest that microvessel counts in non-small cell lung cancer are related to a poor disease outcome, the results were not conclusive and were not compared with other molecular prognostic markers. In the present study, the vascular grade was assessed in 107 (T1,2-N0,1) operable non-small cell lung carcinomas, using the JC70 monoclonal antibody to CD31. Three vascular grades were defined with appraisal by eye and by Chalkley counting: high (Chalkley score 7-12), medium (5-6), and low (2-4). There was a significant correlation between eye appraisal and Chalkley counting (P  less than  0.0001). Vascular grade was not related to histology, grade, proliferation index (Ki67), or EGFR or p53 expression. Tumours from younger patients had a higher grade of angiogenesis (P = 0.05). Apart from the vascular grade, none of the other factors examined was statistically related to lymph node metastasis (P  less than  0.0001). A univariate analysis of survival showed that vascular grade was the most significant prognostic factor (P = 0.0004), followed by N-stage (P = 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, N-stage and vascular grade were not found to be independent prognostic factors, since they were strongly related to each other. Excluding N-stage, vascular grade was the only independent prognostic factor (P = 0.007). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed a statistically significant worse prognosis for patients with high vascular grade, but no difference was observed between low and medium vascular grade. These data suggest that angiogenesis in operable non-small cell lung cancer is a major prognostic factor for survival and, among the parameters tested, is the only factor related to cancer cell migration to lymph nodes.

After a 48-hour incubation period, seven groups of animals were treated for 21 days with fluconazole, with group I acting as a control, and groups II to VII receiving adjunct therapy with the corticosteroid prednisolone (5 or 10 times daily; 3, 9, or 15 days after infection). The degree of corneal infiltration, ulceration, corneal clouding, hypopyon, conjunctivitis, neovascularization, and corneal perforation was monitored over a 24-day period, as well as recultivation and resistance to fluconazole of the C. albicans pathogen. RESULTS: The control group showed the highest level of corneal clouding and neovascularization. In comparison, by day 24, the majority of groups also treated with prednisolone displayed significantly less corneal clouding and neovascularization. An immediate decrease in corneal clouding was observed in groups treated with additional low- or high-dose prednisolone from day 9 after inoculation. After additional prednisolone treatment from day 9 or 15 after inoculation, no significant difference was detected in the recultivation rate of C. albicans compared with the control. Early administration of prednisolone (day 3, low and high dose) resulted in the recultivation of significantly more C. albicans.

HGF were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), vesicle (Ve) and outer membrane protein (OMP) from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis. HGF constitutively produced VEGF and levels were significantly enhanced (P  less than  0.01) by stimulation with Ve and OMP from A. actinomycetemcomitans and P. gingivalis at concentrations of 10 microg/ml or higher. On the other hand, VEGF levels were not increased by LPS stimulation. VEGF mRNA expression was also observed in Ve- and OMP-stimulated HGF. A vascular permeability enhancement (VPE) assay was performed using guinea pigs to ascertain whether supernatant from cultures of Ve- and OMP-stimulated HGF enhance vascular permeability in vivo. Supernatant from cultures of Ve- and OMP-stimulated HGF strongly induced VPE. This was markedly suppressed upon simultaneous injection of anti-VEGF polyclonal antibodies with the supernatant. Heating and protease treatment of the stimulants reduced the VEGF enhancing levels in Ve and OMP in vitro. These results suggest that Ve and OMP may be crucial heat-labile and protease-sensitive components of periodontal pathogens that enhance VEGF expression. In addition, VEGF might be associated with the etiology of periodontitis in its early stages according to neovascularization stimulated by periodontal pathogens causing swelling and edema.\n", "output": "Enhanced <Positive_regulation> vascular endothelial growth factor expression <Gene_expression> VEGF expression <Gene_expression> HGF stimulated <Positive_regulation> VEGF produced <Gene_expression> VEGF expression <Transcription> HGF stimulated <Positive_regulation> HGF stimulated <Positive_regulation> HGF stimulated <Positive_regulation> VEGF expression <Gene_expression> Aberrant <Regulation> HGF stimulation <Positive_regulation> HGF stimulation <Positive_regulation> VEGF increased <Positive_regulation> HGF stimulated <Positive_regulation> vascular enhancement <Positive_regulation> HGF stimulated <Positive_regulation> HGF enhance <Positive_regulation> HGF stimulated <Positive_regulation> anti-VEGF polyclonal antibodies injection <Planned_process> OMP reduced <Negative_regulation> VEGF enhancing <Positive_regulation> reduced <Negative_regulation> stimulated <Positive_regulation> lesion formation <Development>"}, "title": "Enhanced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor by periodontal pathogens in gingival fibroblasts."}

The aim of the present study was to clarify how expression of p53 protein participates in angiogenesis, and whether the coexpression of VEGF and p53 protein has a significance for angiogenesis and the clinicopathological features in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). METHODS: Tissues samples were taken from 60 patients with esophageal SCC after surgery. The expression of VEGF and p53 protein in these SCC was examined immunohistochemically. Microvessel density (MVD) was determined by counting microvessels in tumor sections stained for Factor VIII-related antigen. Ki-67 labeling index (LI) was calculated, based on Ki-67 antigen immunostaining, as a proliferative marker. Apoptotic index (AI) was calculated, based on the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate biotin nick end labeling, to evaluate apoptosis. RESULTS: VEGF expression was observed in 58.3%, and p53 protein expression was observed in 61.7% of the 60 patients. VEGF and p53 protein were significantly coexpressed in 26 (43.4%). Histological venous invasion (p  less than  0.01) and distant metastasis (p  less than  0.05) were significantly correlated with p53 protein expression. The two parameters were more frequently observed in the SCC with VEGF/p53 coexpression than in those without the coexpression. The MVD and Ki-67 LI were significantly higher (p  less than  0.01 and p  less than  0.001), and the AI was significantly lower (p  less than  0.001) in the SCC with p53 protein expression than in the SCC without it. The MVD and Ki-67 LI were higher, and the AI was lower in the SCC with VEGF/p53 coexpression than in those without the coexpression. The 5-yr survival rate in patients with the coexpression was poorer than in the other patients. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that mutant p53 expression is associated with angiogenesis and distant metastasis in esophageal SCC, and that the coexpression of p53 and VEGF may play an important role in angiogenesis, and have important clinical significance.\n", "output": "vascular endothelial growth factor Coexpression <Gene_expression> p53 expression <Gene_expression> VEGF coexpression <Gene_expression> VEGF expression <Gene_expression> VEGF expression <Gene_expression> p53 expression <Gene_expression> p53 coexpressed <Gene_expression> venous invasion <Localization> p53 expression <Gene_expression> p53 coexpression <Gene_expression> p53 expression <Gene_expression> p53 coexpression <Gene_expression> p53 expression <Gene_expression> p53 coexpression <Gene_expression> vascular endothelial growth factor plays a key role <Regulation> Tissues samples taken <Planned_process> patients surgery <Planned_process> p53 expression <Gene_expression> p53 coexpression <Gene_expression> p53 coexpression <Gene_expression> VEGF coexpression <Gene_expression> tumor angiogenesis <Blood_vessel_development> tumor angiogenesis <Blood_vessel_development> esophageal SCC angiogenesis <Blood_vessel_development>"}, "title": "Coexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor and p53 protein in squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus."}

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Porous PLGA microspheres having primary amine groups on the surface were prepared using an oil-in-water (O/W) single emulsion method using Pluronic F-127 as an extractable porogen. Heparin was surface immobilized via covalent conjugation. bFGF was loaded into the heparin functionalized (PLGA-heparin) microspheres by a simple dipping method.

Endothelial cell proliferation plays a pivotal role in the process of angiogenesis. The aim of this study was to compare angiogenesis parameters in low nuclear grade (n=87) vs high nuclear grade CC-RCC (n=63). A panel of antibodies was used for immunohistochemistry: CD34/Ki-67, carbonic anhydrase IX, hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Vessel density (MVD - microvessel density), endothelial cell proliferation fraction (ECP%) and tumour cell proliferation fraction (TCP%) were assessed. mRNA expression levels of angiogenesis stimulators and inhibitors were determined by quantitative RT-PCR. High-grade CC-RCC showed a higher ECP% (P=0.049), a higher TCP% (P=0.009), a higher VEGF protein expression (P less than 0.001), a lower MVD (P less than  0.001) and a lower HIF-1alpha protein expression (P=0.002) than low-grade CC-RCC. Growth factor mRNA expression analyses revealed a higher expression of angiopoietin 2 in low-grade CC-RCC. Microvessel density and ECP% were inversely correlated (Rho=-0.26, P=0.001). Because of the imperfect association of nuclear grade and ECP% or MVD, CC-RCC was also grouped based on low/high MVD and ECP%. This analysis revealed a higher expression of vessel maturation and stabilisation factors (placental growth factor, PDGFB1, angiopoietin 1) in CC-RCC with high MVD, a group of CC-RCC highly enriched in low nuclear grade CC-RCC, with low ECP%.

Prior studies showed enhancement of such carcinogenesis by repeated 20 rad head and neck X-radiation exposures, and it was proposed that one possible mechanism was radiogenic alteration of the functional microvasculature in a manner which favored subsequent tumor development. Hamsters were treated with either radiation, DMBA, radiation + DMBA, or no treatment. Animals were sacrificed at 3-week intervals from 0 to 39 weeks after treatments began. Pouch vascular volume and permeability changes were studied by fractional distributions of radiotracers and were analyzed by a variety of statistical methods which explored the vascular parameters, treatment types, elapsed time, presence of the carcinogen, and histopathologic changes. All treatments resulted in significant changes in vascular volume with time, while only DMBA treatments alone resulted in significant changes in vascular permeability with time. Prior to the appearances of frank neoplasms, volumetric changes in DMBA only and radiation only groups were similar, while volume changes in DMBA + radiation groups increased slowly to a peak later than in other groups and then declined steadily to levels similar to the radiation only group. As in prior studies, there were significant vascular volume differences between DMBA and DMBA + radiation groups of tumor-bearing cheek pouches. DMBA maxima were significantly higher than those of DMBA + radiation. Radiation significantly affected DMBA-associated vascular volume and permeability changes during carcinogenesis. Several possible explanations for the relationship of these changes to the enhancement of DMBA carcinogenesis include: radiation blocking normal capillary proliferative and/or dilatory responses to inflammation secondary to neoplastic changes; radiation-induced focal increases in the pericapillary connective tissue histohematic barrier, stimulating angiogenesis but reducing nutrient diffusion; radiation exposures sensitizing vascular endothelium to subsequent angiogenic stimulation from premalignant tissues; DMBA vascular and epithelial effects partially or completely blocking radiation effects on epithelial and/or endothelial cells; and radiation damage to vessel walls partially or fully inhibiting normal physiologic mechanisms of repairing DMBA damage to the vessels.\n", "output": "microvasculature alteration <Regulation> tumor development <Development> capillary proliferative <Growth> vascular changes <Regulation> effects <Regulation> microvascular changes <Regulation> neck X-radiation exposures <Planned_process> head X-radiation exposures <Planned_process> microvasculature alteration <Regulation> Hamsters treated <Planned_process> Hamsters treatment <Planned_process> Hamsters treated <Planned_process> vascular changes <Regulation> DMBA changes <Regulation> DMBA changes <Regulation> neoplasms changes <Regulation> increased <Positive_regulation> vascular affected <Regulation> DMBA associated <Regulation> DMBA enhancement <Positive_regulation> stimulating <Positive_regulation> stimulation <Positive_regulation> epithelial effects <Regulation> endothelial cells effects <Regulation> DMBA blocking <Negative_regulation> DMBA blocking <Negative_regulation> vessel walls damage <Breakdown> vessels damage <Breakdown>"}, "title": "Low-level X-radiation effects on functional vascular changes in Syrian hamster cheek pouch epithelium during hydrocarbon carcinogenesis."}

In some cancers, syndecan expression has been shown to regulate tumor cell function (e.g. proliferation, adhesion, and motility) and serve as a prognostic marker for tumor progression and patient survival. The ectodomains and heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan chains of syndecans can also act as receptors/co-receptors for some bacterial and viral pathogens, mediating infection. In addition, syndecans bind to obesity-related factors and regulate their signaling, in turn modulating food consumption and weight balance. In vivo animal models of tissue injury and in vitro data also implicate syndecans in processes necessary for wound healing, including fibroblast and endothelial proliferation, cell motility, angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix organization.

In addition, the microtubule-destabilizing agents cause prominent changes in endothelial cell morphology, an action associated with rapid vascular collapse in vivo. The effects on endothelial cells occur in vitro at low drug concentrations, which do not affect microtubule gross morphology, do not cause microtubule bundling or microtubule loss and do not induce cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, or cell death. Rather, it has been hypothesized that, at low concentrations, MBDs produce more subtle effects on microtubule dynamics, block critical cell signaling pathways, and prevent the microtubules from properly interacting with transient subcellular assemblies (focal adhesions and adherens junctions) whose subsequent stabilization and/or maturation are required for cell motility and cell-cell interactions.

Here, we investigate the role of TSP-1 in tumor-stroma reaction, which is mainly characterized by fibroblast activation to create a permissive microenvironment for tumor progression. Immunohistochemistry examinations in the human surgical specimens have shown that a downregulation of TSP-1 during the progression of cervical carcinogenesis was accompanied by an emergence in the upregulation of stroma markers, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and desmin. Transfection of SiHa cervical cancer cells with a plasmid expressing the TSP-1 protein exhibited antiangiogenic activity in vitro and resulted in reduced tumor growth in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice, which was accompanied by a decrease in tumor vascularization and lower expressions of alpha-SMA and desmin than those in the vector controls. Transfection with TSP-1 and purified TSP-1 added to NIH3T3 cells did not alter the protein levels of alpha-SMA and desmin but significantly inhibited matrix metalloprotease-2 activity. Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), a major factor in the activation of fibroblasts, increased alpha-SMA and desmin expression and the ability of cell migration and invasion in NIH3T3 cells. The increased migration ability and the invasive ability into tumor cluster of TGF-beta-treated NIH3T3 cells were dose dependently inhibited by TSP-1. In contrast, ectopic TSP-1 expression in SiHa cells has little effect on the invasive ability of the NIH3T3 cells.

However, how survivin couples to the cell death machinery has remained elusive, and the relevant cellular targets of survivin antagonists have not been completely elucidated. Experimental Design: Human umbilical vein and dermal microvascular endothelial cells were infected with replication-deficient adenoviruses encoding survivin (pAd-Survivin), green fluorescent protein (pAd-GFP), or a phosphorylation-defective survivin Thr(34)-->Ala (pAd-T34A) dominant negative mutant. The effect of wild-type or mutant survivin was investigated on capillary network stability, endothelial cell viability, and caspase activation in vitro and on kinetics of tumor growth and development of angiogenesis in a breast cancer xenograft model in vivo. The cell death pathway initiated by survivin targeting was mapped with respect to cytochrome c release, changes in mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and apoptosome requirements using mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in Apaf-1 or caspase-9. RESULTS: Adenoviral transduction of endothelial cells with pAd-Survivin inhibited growth factor deprivation- or ceramide-induced apoptosis, reduced caspase-3 and -7 generation, and stabilized three-dimensional capillary networks in vitro. Conversely, expression of pAd-T34A caused apoptosis in umbilical vein and dermal microvascular endothelial cells and resulted in caspase-3 activity. Cell death induced by survivin targeting exhibited the hallmarks of mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis with release of cytochrome c and loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential and was suppressed in Apaf-1 or caspase-9 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts. When injected in human breast cancer xenografts, pAd-T34A inhibited growth of established tumors and triggered tumor cell apoptosis in vivo. This was associated with a approximately 60% reduction in tumor-derived blood vessels by quantitative morphometry of CD31-stained tumor areas, and appearance of endothelial cell apoptosis by internucleosomal DNA fragmentation in vivo.

VEGF activates phospholipases (PLCs) - specifically PLCgamma1 - that are important for tubulogenesis, differentiation and DNA synthesis. However, we show here that VEGF, specifically through VEGFR2, induces phosphorylation of two serine residues on PLCbeta3, and this was confirmed in an ex vivo embryoid body model. Knockdown of PLCbeta3 in HUVEC cells affects IP3 production, actin reorganization, migration and proliferation; whereas migration is inhibited, proliferation is enhanced. Our data suggest that enhanced proliferation is precipitated by an accelerated cell cycle, and decreased migration by an inability to activate CDC42.

RESULTS: The mean Rentrop collateral score was higher in Group 1 than in Group 2 (2.39 +/- 1.07 vs. 1.76 +/- 0.76, respectively, p  less than  0.001). When the two groups were compared with respect to poor and good CCC, poor CCC was higher in patients with PDR (64 vs. 36%, respectively, p = 0.01). Serum VEGF levels were higher in patients with PDR than in those without DR (219 +/- 99 vs. 139 +/- 98 pg/ml, p  less than  0.001); however, patients with poor and good CCC had similar VEGF levels. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that patients with PDR have a lower coronary collateral score than patients without DR.

In the present study, a novel inhibitor of angiogenesis was synthesized by covalently linking a nonanticoagulating derivative of heparin, heparin adipic hydrazide (HAH), by an acid-labile bond to the antiangiogenic steroid, cortisol. The rationale was that the heparin derivative, which binds to sulfated polyanion receptors on endothelial cells, should concentrate the steroid on the surface of vascular endothelial cells. Endocytosis of the conjugate and decomposition of the acid-labile linkage inside lysosomes and other acidic intracellular compartments should then lead to release of the cortisol and expression of its antiproliferative activity. Analysis of the stability of HAH-cortisol showed that it was stable at pH 7.4 and broke down rapidly (t1/2 15 min) at pH 4.8 at 37 degrees C. Treatment of murine pulmonary capillary endothelial cells with HAH-cortisol at 10(-5) M (with respect to cortisol) suppressed their DNA synthesis by 50% and inhibited their migration into wounded areas of confluent monolayers. HAH-cortisol at 10(-4) M (with respect to cortisol) did not suppress the DNA synthesis of Lewis lung carcinoma cells. Daily i.p. injections of HAH-cortisol into mice bearing s.c. sponge implants retarded vascularization of the sponge, and injections directly into the sponge abolished vascularization for as long as the injections were continued. Daily i.v. injections of HAH-cortisol at doses causing no apparent toxicity retarded the growth of solid s.c. Lewis lung carcinomas in mice by up to 65%. In all of these assays, equivalent treatments with a mixture of the HAH plus cortisol was significantly less effective. The antiproliferative effect of HAH-cortisol on endothelial cells appeared independent of the glucocorticoid activity of the steroid since HAH conjugated to 5 beta-pregnane-3 alpha,17 alpha,21-triol-20-one, a steroid lacking glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid activity, was even more effective at inhibiting DNA synthesis by murine pulmonary capillary endothelial cells than was HAH-cortisol.

SUMMARY: Staging of colorectal cancer occurs after surgery and is based on the extent of disease invasiveness and dissemination. Surgery is the primary treatment for stage I disease. Adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended after resection in selected high-risk patients with stage II disease and in all patients with stage III disease. Convenience of administration, tolerability, and patient factors not necessarily age may be considerations in decisions about adjuvant therapy after resection. Treatment of stage IV colorectal cancer is based on the type of prior therapy and patient-specific factors. Recently, significant improvements in survival have been achieved through the use of combination chemotherapy and monoclonal antibody regimens. Bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy is first-line therapy for stage IV disease. Age alone should not preclude the use of chemotherapy in stage IV colorectal cancer, although the ability to tolerate drug-related toxicity may be a consideration. The optimal duration of chemotherapy in patients with early and metastatic colorectal cancer is unclear.

This review summarizes the current state of the art concerning the involvement of aberrant Pten function in the development of different biologic features of malignant gliomas, such as loss of cell-cycle control and uncontrolled cell proliferation, escape from apoptosis, brain invasion, and aberrant neoangiogenesis. Most of the tumor-suppressive properties of Pten are dependent on its lipid phosphatase activity, which inhibits the phosphatidylinositol-3'-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway through dephosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-triphosphate. The additional function of Pten as a dual-specificity protein phosphatase may also play a role in glioma pathogenesis. Besides the wealth of data elucidating the functional roles of Pten, recent studies suggest a diagnostic significance of PTEN gene alterations as a molecular marker for poor prognosis in anaplastic astrocytomas and anaplastic oligodendrogliomas. Furthermore, the possibility of selective targeting of PTEN mutant tumor cells by specific pharmacologic inhibitors of members of the Pten/PI3K/Akt pathway opens up new perspectives for a targeted molecular therapy of malignant gliomas.\n", "output": "phosphatidylinositol-(3,4,5)-triphosphate dephosphorylation <Dephosphorylation> PTEN alterations <Regulation> PTEN mutant tumor cells selective targeting <Planned_process> Pten role <Regulation> brain development <Development> malignant gliomas development <Development> Pten dependent <Regulation> Pten inhibits <Regulation> Pten play a role <Regulation> Pten role <Regulation> gliomas therapy <Planned_process> tumor suppressor <Negative_regulation> cell proliferation <Cell_proliferation> uncontrolled <Regulation> malignant gliomas neoangiogenesis <Blood_vessel_development> cell apoptosis <Death> Pten aberrant <Regulation> malignant gliomas invasion <Localization> Pten signaling <Pathway> Akt signaling pathway <Pathway> Pten pathway <Pathway>"}, "title": "Pten signaling in gliomas."}

The internal convex surface of the caruncles of non-pregnant does was covered with capillary meshes of regular diameter and form, without crypts.

At later stages, branches of radial arteries penetrated the periphery forming an extensive mesh of capillaries on the concave surface. Capillary diameters increased significantly during pregnancy, especially after 4 weeks, when large flattened sinusoids formed. These sinusoids had a great deal of surface area for potential contact with the fetal component.

Under physiological conditions, angiogenesis is regulated by local balance between endogenous stimulators and inhibitors of this process. In many diseases state body loses control over angiogenesis. Angiogenesis-dependent diseases result when new blood vessels either grow excessively or insufficiently. Insufficient angiogenesis occurs in diseases such as coronary artery disease, stroke and chronic wounds. Myocardial ischemia both acute and chronic has been clearly shown to stimulate angiogenesis in many experimental models. Therapeutic angiogenesis is the biological agents or bioactive material to stimulate the growth of new blood vessels. Traditional coronary revascularization therapies such as coronary angioplasty or bypass graft surgery, act by restoring blood flow through the preexisting coronary vessels. One limitation of these approaches, however, may be the failure to normalize myocardial perfusion, due to the concomitant presence or small of resistance vessel disease. In contrast, therapeutic angiogenesis is based on the concept that coronary collateral development may be stimulated by pharmacological or molecular means and can limit myocardial ischemia. Studies, both in human and animal models support the notion that, various angiogenic growth factors and progenitor cells can enhance new blood vessels. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), recombinant proteins and bone marrow stem cells are currently used therapeutic stimulators for angiogenesis. As coronary artery disease is the major cause of death in the developed societies and also an emerging health problem in developing countries like Bangladesh therapeutic angiogenesis may provide hope as a new treatment modality for ischemic heart disease with or in place of current therapies.\n", "output": "regulation <Regulation> blood vessels growth <Growth> blood restoring <Regulation> coronary collateral development <Development> blood vessels forming <Development> blood vessels growth <Growth> regulated <Regulation> control <Regulation> blood vessels grow <Growth> stimulate <Positive_regulation> stimulate <Positive_regulation> coronary vessels preexisting <Localization> stimulated <Positive_regulation> blood vessels enhance <Positive_regulation> blood vessels enhance <Positive_regulation>"}, "title": "Angiogenesis-a novel therapeutic approach for ischemic heart disease."}

In the current study, Hedgehog signaling in tumor related vasculature and microenvironment was examined using human umbilical vein endothelial cells and B16F0 (murine melanoma) tumors models. Use of exogenous Sonic hedgehog (Shh) peptide significantly increased BrdU incorporation in endothelial cells in vitro by a factor of 2 (P  less than  0.001). The Hedgehog pathway antagonist cyclopamine effectively reduced Shh-induced proliferation to control levels. To study Hedgehog signaling in vivo a hind limb tumor model with the B16F0 cell line was used. Treatment with 25 mg/kg cyclopamine significantly attenuated BrdU incorporation in tumor cells threefold (P  less than  0.001), in tumor related endothelial cells threefold (P = 0.004), and delayed tumor growth by 4 days. Immunohistochemistry revealed that the Hedgehog receptor Patched was localized to the tumor stroma and that B16F0 cells expressed Shh peptide. Furthermore, mouse embryonic fibroblasts required the presence of B16F0 cells to express Patched in a co-culture assay system. These studies indicate that Shh peptide produced by melanoma cells induces Patched expression in fibroblasts. To study tumor related angiogenesis a vascular window model was used to monitor tumor vascularity. Treatment with cyclopamine significantly attenuated vascular formation by a factor of 2.5 (P  less than  0.001) and altered vascular morphology.

Inhibition of the autocrine angiotensin system with the converting-enzyme inhibitor or the receptor antagonist also leads to increased expression of the proto-oncogene c-src: pp60c-src mRNA increased 7-11-fold, c-src protein 3-fold, and c-src kinase activity 2-3-fold. Endothelial cell expression of c-src was constitutively elevated after stable infection with a retroviral vector containing the c-src coding sequence. Constitutively increased c-src kinase activity reconstituted the increases in migration and u-PA observed with angiotensin system interruption. Antisera to bovine u-PA blocked the increase in migration associated with increased c-src expression. These data suggest that increases in endothelial cell migration and plasminogen activator after angiotensin system inhibition are at least partially pp60c-src mediated.

We further support this hypothesis by providing the first evidence that TnI can act on nonendothelial as well as endothelial cells and by demonstrating that this inhibitory action is specific for the bFGF receptor on the target cells.

METHODS: The authors evaluated plasma endostatin (PE) levels using an enzyme linked immunoassay in 71 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 43 patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and correlated PE with various clinical parameters. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the median PE level between AML/MDS patients and the normal controls. Nevertheless, patients who achieved complete remission (CR) had a significantly lower median PE level compared to those who did not. In multivariate analysis, PE was found to be a significant (P = 0.03) predictor of overall survival (OS) with adjustment of the other baseline covariates, including patient age, history of antecedent hematologic disorders, and the use of protective environments. The prognostic value of PE was also evaluated by dividing MDS/AML patients into high and low PE groups using the median PE level of normal controls as the cut-off. The authors found that patients in the high PE group survived for a significantly shorter time than those patients in the low PE group. CONCLUSIONS: PE is a useful prognostic predictor of CR and OS for AML/MDS patients.

METHODS: To evaluate antiangiogenic activity of cRGD-HL, we performed tests on endothelial cell adhesion and migration to vitronectin, tube formation, binding affinity to purified alpha(v)beta(3) integrin, and in vivo Matrigel plug assay. The antitumor activity of cRGD-HL was also evaluated by monitoring tumor growth and microvessel formation in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC7) tumor.

The enhanced antiangiogenic effect of cRGD-HL was confirmed in Matrigel assay by showing the significant inhibition of bFGF-driven angiogenesis and blood vessel formation.

Because proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix is a critical component of endothelial invasion in angiogenesis, it is logical to assume that PSMA participates in matrix degradation. However, we demonstrate a novel and more complex role for PSMA in angiogenesis, where it is a principal component of a regulatory loop that is tightly modulating laminin-specific integrin signaling and GTPase-dependent, p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK-1) activity. We show that PSMA inhibition, knockdown, or deficiency decreases endothelial cell invasion in vitro via integrin and PAK, thus abrogating angiogenesis. Interestingly, the neutralization of beta(1) or the inactivation of PAK increases PSMA activity, suggesting that they negatively regulate PSMA. This negative regulation is mediated by the cytoskeleton as the disruption of interactions between the PSMA cytoplasmic tail and the anchor protein filamin A decreases PSMA activity, integrin function, and PAK activation. Finally, the inhibition of PAK activation enhances the PSMA/filamin A interaction and, thus, boosts PSMA activity. These data imply that PSMA participates in an autoregulatory loop, wherein active PSMA facilitates integrin signaling and PAK activation, leading to both productive invasion and downregulation of integrin beta(1) signaling via reduced PSMA activity.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is one of the most potent and a specific regulator of angiogenesis which principally targets endothelial cells and regulates several of their functions, including mitogenesis, permeability and migration. The impact of elevated VEGF expression on the course of chronic myeloid leukaemia is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was the follow-up of VEGF expression during the course of CML. METHODS: We studied VEGF expression of 85 CML patients (median age 50 years, range 16-75 years). At the commencement of the study, 29 patients were in chronic phase (CP), 25 in an accelerated phase (AP), and 31 in the blast crisis (BC). The temporal expression (percentage positivity per 1000 analysed cells) VEGF proteins over the course of CML were studied using the immunohistochemical technique utilizing relevant monoclonal antibodies. It was correlated with the laboratory (Hb, WBC and platelet counts, and the percentage of blasts) and clinical parameters (organomegaly, duration of CP, AP, and BC) of disease progression. RESULTS: The expression ofVEGF protein was most pronounced in AP (ANOVA, p=0.033). The level of VEGF expression correlated inversely with the degree of splenomegaly (Pearson, r=-0.400, p=0.011). High expression of VEGF correlated with a shorter overall survival (log rank, p=0.042). CONCLUSION: Immunohistochemically confirmed significance of the expression of VEGF in dependence of the CML stage could be of clinical importance in deciding on the timing therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two MRI exams were performed with intravascular contrast media in 21 rats: tumours were induced by subcutaneous injection of colon carcinoma cells in 7 rats and mammary adenocarcinoma cells in 14 rats. Perfusion and permeability parameters of the implanted tumours were evaluated by using two contrast media (B22956/1 and Gd-DTPA37-albumin) to establish response to treatment with two different antiangiogenic drugs (tamoxifen and SU6668).

Among the most potent of the angiogenic factors is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Increased VEGF expression by malignant tumors has been associated with high vascularity, increased cancer cell growth, and lymph node metastasis. Reduced oxygen tension has been shown to increase VEGF production by induction of the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1alpha). The mechanisms by which hypoxic tumor environments induce HIF-1alpha and VEGF expression are largely unknown. Jun N terminal kinase (JNK1) and p38 kinase are activated by a variety of stress stimuli. To determine if hypoxic activation of these stress activated protein kinases regulated HIF-1alpha and VEGF expression, we assayed JNK1 and p38 activity in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) lines grown under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia rapidly induced both JNK1 and p38 activity in these cells. This activation correlated with induction of HIF-1alpha expression and DNA binding activity which was blocked by the p38 inhibitor SB203580. Hypoxia also increased VEGF production by SCC lines, which was inhibited by treatment with SB203580. Overexpression of JNK1 or p38 was sufficient to induce HIF-1alpha and VEGF expression.

The aim of this study is to compare behavior and tissue response between two new polyester prostheses and a commonly used polypropylene (PP) mesh. The polyester prostheses utilized were polyester flat (PF) and polyester soft three-dimensional (PS); the PP mesh utilized was Marlex. Eight randomly assigned 4 x 4-cm2 pieces of two different meshes were fixed in the preperitoneal space with a centrally placed single suture. Gross evaluation included shrinkage and stiffness. Histological evaluation included amount of fibrous and fat encapsulation, connective tissue, foreign-body reaction, neovascularization, hemorrhage, necrosis, and exudate. Evaluations were graded on a zero to four scale. The area and the area ratio were measured using a calibrated micrometer. PP mesh resulted in more fibrous encapsulation and stiffness than PF and PS prostheses. PP also resulted in less connective tissue formation and foreign-body reaction than PF and PS prostheses. There was no difference in fat encapsulation, necrosis, hemorrhage, or exudate between prostheses. Both polyester prostheses (PF and PS) have better tissue integration than the PP mesh, as evidenced by the higher amount of connective tissue and lower extent of fibrous encapsulation.\n", "output": "fat encapsulation <Localization> fibrous encapsulation <Localization> connective tissue formation <Development> fat encapsulation <Localization> fibrous encapsulation <Localization> fibrous encapsulation <Localization> resulted <Positive_regulation> resulted <Positive_regulation> connective tissue necrosis <Death> fat necrosis <Death>"}, "title": "Comparison of tissue integration between polyester and polypropylene prostheses in the preperitoneal space."}

Whereas agents seem promising in the test tube, clinical trials often fail due to unfavorable pharmacokinetics, poor delivery, low local concentrations, and limited accumulation in the target cell. A major step forwards in the treatment of solid tumors is the recognition of the tumor-associated vasculature as an important target for therapy. Inhibition of tumor vascular development has a direct effect on the growth and progression of the tumor. Destruction of an existing vasculature also directly inflicts serious damage to the tumor cell. Moreover, the tumor vascular bed can be manipulated facilitating enhanced permissiveness of the tumor for administered chemotherapeutics. In this review, we focus on the use of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) in local and systemic therapy in conjunction with chemotherapy. In these settings TNF demonstrates potent and selective activity on the tumor vascular bed, which strongly improves tumor response.\n", "output": "tumor vascular development <Development> vasculature Destruction <Breakdown> tumor vascular bed manipulated <Regulation> Solid tumor therapy <Planned_process> vasculature manipulation <Regulation> solid tumors treatment <Planned_process> Inhibition <Negative_regulation> tumor growth <Growth> tumor progression <Development> tumor administered <Planned_process> tumor necrosis factor alpha therapy <Planned_process> TNF improves <Positive_regulation> tumor cell damage <Breakdown>"}, "title": "Solid tumor therapy: manipulation of the vasculature with TNF."}

The fibrinolytic (plasminogen/plasmin) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) systems cooperate in these processes. A nutritionally induced obesity model in transgenic mice has been used extensively to study the role of the fibrinolytic and MMP systems in the development of obesity.

There is accumulating evidence that the tissue damage associated with chronic wounds is initiated and propagated by an inappropriately excessive inflammatory response. Research on age-related impaired wound healing suggests that the decline in sex steroid hormones with age may have a substantial influence on the inflammatory response in vivo. Topical and systemic estrogen treatments have shown an increased rate of healing by reducing inflammation, however the underlying mechanisms are little understood. In vitro studies also suggest progesterone may play a role in modulating inflammation. Macrophages are essential mediators of inflammation and wound healing. Macrophages can be activated in a classical or alternative manner in parallel with the T(H)1/T(H)2 dichotomy, respectively. Using a murine incisional wound healing model this study was carried out to investigate the roles of estrogen and progesterone on macrophage activation during the wound healing response. Our findings suggest with a reduction of steroid hormones following ovariectomy, alternatively activated macrophage markers (Fizz1 and Ym1) were reduced, with this effect being reversed with the administration of estrogen or progesterone; suggesting that with the reduction of steroid hormones macrophages are activated in a classical manner, promoting inflammation, whereas estrogen or progesterone are contributing toward macrophage activation in an alternative manner, driving wound repair, angiogenesis, and remodeling.\n", "output": "macrophage activation <Positive_regulation> Macrophages activated <Positive_regulation> macrophage activation <Positive_regulation> steroid hormones reduction <Negative_regulation> estrogen administration <Planned_process> steroid hormones reduction <Negative_regulation> macrophages activated <Positive_regulation> macrophage activation <Positive_regulation> estrogen treatments <Planned_process> Fizz1 activated <Positive_regulation> Ym1 reduced <Negative_regulation> Fizz1 reduced <Negative_regulation> Ym1 activated <Positive_regulation> tissue damage <Breakdown> initiated <Positive_regulation> progesterone administration <Planned_process>"}, "title": "Effect of estrogen and progesterone on macrophage activation during wound healing."}

In each experimental situation, the casts provided a valuable three dimensional representation of the newly formed blood vessels and permitted subclassification of the vessels within normal and proliferating vascular networks. They defined also the predominant origin of new vessels from venules and capillaries, and enabled the evolution of proliferating vessels into arterioles and venules to be documented.

Estrogen is crucial in breast carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Whether sex steroids affect IL-8 secretion of normal breast tissue or breast cancer is not known. Several cell types in a tissue secrete IL-8. Hence, regulatory mechanisms of IL-8 need to be investigated in whole tissue. We used microdialysis to sample IL-8 in normal human breast tissue in situ in pre- and postmenopausal women, preoperatively in breast cancers of women, and in experimental breast cancer in mice. We found a significant positive correlation between IL-8 and estradiol in normal breast tissue and hormone-dependent breast cancer in vivo. Ex vivo, estradiol exposure increased the IL-8 secretion of normal whole breast tissue in culture. In experimental breast cancer, estradiol increased IL-8 whereas the anti-estrogen tamoxifen inhibited the secretion of IL-8 both in vitro and extracellularly in vivo in tumors of nude mice. An anti-IL-8 Ab inhibited endothelial cell proliferation induced by cancer cell produced IL-8 and tumors with low IL-8 levels exhibited decreased angiogenesis. Our results strongly suggest that estradiol has a critical role in the regulation of IL-8 in normal human breast tissue and human breast cancer.

The stromal fibrous reaction associated to infiltrating carcinomas is responsible of focal increased density, and architectural distorsion, ultrasound acoustic shadowing; abnormal neoangiogenesis can be detected by Doppler, CT or MR imaging. Invasive carcinomas without spiculated margins are poorly differentiated tumors. Mammographic patterns of microcalcifications depend on their physiopathological process (necrosis, secretion), and the shape of clusters (round, triangular) typifies their anatomical site of origin (lobular, ductal). Less frequent lesions (invasive lobular, mucinous, and medullary carcinomas, radial scar) will be also explained based on radiopathological correlations.
