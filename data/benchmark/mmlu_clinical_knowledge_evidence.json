The majority of the body’s K+ content is found in the intracellular space of skeletal muscle[]. pH-dependent control of potassium homeostasis occurs in the distal tubule of the nephron via the H+-K+-ATPase transporter]. These channels are directly affected by acute acidosis. When plasma pH drops, K+ is released from the intracellular space and K+ movement into the intracellular space results in a shift of potassium into the ECF space. These effects are mediated by three main mechanisms[]: Firstly, the sodium-hydrogen ion exchanger is inhibited, causing decreased sodium-K+-adenosine triphosphatase (Na+K+ATPase) activity; secondly, Na+ influx via the Na+HCO3 co-transporter is inhibited by a fall in extracellular HCO3, again decreasing Na+K+ATPase activity; finally, chloride influx via the chloride-bicarbonate ion Cl exchange is reduced, due to the fall in extracellular HCO3, promoting K+ efflux into ECF via the K+Cl- co-transporter.

Hence the terms upper motor neurone facial weakness and lower motor neurone facial weakness, the former resulting from higher damage and the latter from damage to the facial nerve or its nucleus. Later Charles Sherrington (1857-1952) named this the ‘final common pathway’ from brain via the spinal cord to the muscles. Hence the upper face is not spared in Bell’s palsy (a lower motor neurone palsy) but may be spared in an upper motor neurone lesion.

The causes remain unknown, although around 5% of cases have a genetic basis. Survival is usually only three to five years from diagnosis. MND affects both upper and lower motor neurones, with variable contributions. The nerve involvement in MND usually has a focal onset, is asymmetrical, but tends to spread to adjacent regions of the body. If the affected region is in the legs, a common presenting feature is tripping, falls or foot drop. If it is in the arms there may be difficulty with fine tasks such as fastening buttons, or raising an arm, and if the cranial nerves are affected there may be slurring of speech, or difficulty swallowing. Key to the diagnosis is evidence of progression, and this may lead to some delay in considering and also confirming the diagnosis. When examining the patient, evidence of more widespread neuromuscular involvement should be looked for. In a patient with foot drop, and fasciculation of the tongue, MND would be a likely diagnosis. Upper motor neurone involvement may be readily determined by examining the reflexes. Brisk reflexes, in the arms, legs or jaw, in the context of features of lower motor neurone denervation are highly suggestive of MND. Suspicion of MND should lead to referral for a neurology opinion. The most useful investigation is likely to be EMG with nerve conduction studies, and probably MRI scan of relevant areas. Blood tests are arranged to screen for any other causative condition.

Rapid adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis during high-intensity exercise builds up adenosine di-phosphate and adenosine monophosphate (AMP). In the further metabolic degeneration cascade known as the purine nucleotide cycle, AMP is deaminated into inosinomono-phosphate, with the parallel formation of ammonia (NH3). Because ammonia is correlated with the number of fast switch muscle fibres, an increase in lactate and efficacy of oxidative metabolism, this may suggest that ammonia might be an important player in modulation of central fatigue [].", "pmid": "29158619", "journal_title": "N/A", "PubDate_year": null, "PubDate_month": null, "PubDate_date": null}, {"rank": 5, "score": 109.34932, "title": "Effect of burdock extract on physical performance and physiological fatigue\nin mice", "text": "Glucose is transported to skeletal muscle to fulfil energy requirements, but anaerobic\nglycolysis occurs and results in lactate accumulation during high intensity exercise.\nIncreased lactate levels lower pH, resulting in various biochemical and physiological side\neffects affecting glycolysis, phosphofructokinase, and muscular contractions caused by\ncalcium ion release [].

These superficial reflexes are abolished in patients with an upper motor neuron lesion, wherein normal plantar response is replaced by the Babinski response.[] Anatomically, the upgoing toe, an important component of the Babinski sign, is an extension of the great toe.[] Physiologically, it is part of a flexor reflex synergy of the lower limb as described by Sherrington.[] The main function of the flexor reflex synergy is to contract flexor muscles of the lower limb and shorten the limb as a protective reflex. As the central nervous system matures, this flexor reflex synergy is inhibited to facilitate ambulation. However, with upper motor neuron dysfunction, it is disinhibited, thereby resulting in reflex flexion withdrawal, the Babinski sign being only a part of this reflex. It has been suggested that dysfunction of pyramidal tract fibers, which project on interneurons that subserve the flexor reflex synergy, leads to the phenomenon of disinhibition and the appearance of Babinski sign.[] On the other hand, weakness in the same area that is representing dorsiflexors of the great toe occurs due to impaired function of the fibers that project directly onto the motoneurons of the effector muscles.[] It is well known that following an acute lesion in the cerebral hemispheres, there is initially a profound inhibition of the monosynaptic stretch reflexes and, after a variable period of time, the myotatic reflexes become hyperactive. Similarly, as the time progresses, with chronic pyramidal dysfunction, the threshold of the Babinski reflex gradually decreases, while its receptive field (the area from which the reflex can be elicited) gradually increases. In some instances, this field may extend to the leg or thigh.[] This led to the description of many “reflexes” such as Chaddock's, Oppenheim's, and Gordon's signs, which were simply different ways of eliciting the Babinski sign.] Estanol in his study demonstrated that most of the patients with acute cerebrovascular occlusion show a gradual decline in the threshold and, at the same time, increase in the receptive field, for elicitation of the Babinski sign.[] Our case also exemplifies this phenomenon.

The clinical picture varies, depending on the location of the lesion of the facial nerve along its course to the muscles. Symptoms and signs result from the fact that the facial nerve not only carries motor fibers including fibers to the stapedius muscle but also supplies autonomic innervation of the lacrimal gland, submandibular gland, sensation to part of the ear, and taste to the anterior two thirds of the tongue via the chorda tympani []. Thus, Bell’s palsy is diagnosed upon abrupt onset of impaired facial expression due to unilateral facial weakness of all facial nerve branches, dry eye, if saliva runs out of the mouth, the inability to close or wink the eye or close the mouth, to droop the brow or the corner of the mouth, numbness or pain around the ear, temple, mastoid, or angle of the mandible, an altered sense of taste, hypersensitivity to sounds, or decreased tearing (Fig. 1)]. If the patient wants to smile he appears unilaterally expressionless []. Patients may also mention otalgia, aural fullness, or mild retroauricular pain, which may even precede the palsy [].

In half of the herpes zoster infections, vesiculation not necessarily appears or may be delayed (zoster sine herpete).

J Ramsay Hunt, who described various clinical presentations of facial paralysis and rash, also recognised other frequent symptoms and signs such as tinnitus, hearing loss, nausea, vomiting, vertigo, and nystagmus. He explained these eighth nerve features by the close proximity of the geniculate ganglion to the vestibulocochlear nerve within the bony facial canal. Hunt's analysis of clinical variations of the syndrome now bearing his name led to his recognition of the general somatic sensory function of the facial nerve and his defining of the geniculate zone of the ear. It is now known that varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Compared with Bell's palsy (facial paralysis without rash), patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome often have more severe paralysis at onset and are less likely to recover completely. Studies suggest that treatment with prednisone and acyclovir may improve outcome, although a prospective randomised treatment trial remains to be undertaken. In the only prospective study of patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome, 14% developed vesicles after the onset of facial weakness. Thus, Ramsay Hunt syndrome may initially be indistinguishable from Bell's palsy. Further, Bell's palsy is significantly associated with herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. In the light of the known safety and effectiveness of antiviral drugs against VZV or HSV, consideration should be given to early treatment of all patients with Ramsay Hunt syndrome or Bell's palsy with a 7-10 day course of famciclovir (500 mg, three times daily) or acyclovir (800 mg, five times daily), as well as oral prednisone (60 mg daily for 3-5 days). Finally, some patients develop peripheral facial paralysis without ear or mouth rash, associated with either a fourfold rise in antibody to VZV or the presence of VZV DNA in auricular skin, blood mononuclear cells, middle ear fluid, or saliva.

Informal care was mainly accounted for by the time spent supervising a patient (hours on call), and to a lesser extent, bathing, dressing, cooking and cleaning. This highlights the importance of informal care particular in advanced disease. It is essential to account for informal care cost because in the absence of informal carers, possibly the same amount of care would need to be provided by formal carers via health or social care services. For example, certain patients (e.g. patients on medical equipment like tracheostomies or non-invasive ventilation or at risk of falls) will require 24-h supervision. In the United Kingdom, if such patients do not have informal carers, then often they are cared for in care-homes where they are supervised by formal carers, and the health service bears the cost.

Nevertheless, if the cost of supervising patients was completely excluded from our analysis, informal care would still account for more than 50% of the total cost of care.

Temporary fatigue after periods of intense exercise in the game does not appear to be linked directly to muscle glycogen concentration, lactate accumulation, acidity or the breakdown of creatine phosphate. Instead, it may be related to disturbances in muscle ion homeostasis and an impaired excitation of the sarcolemma. Soccer players' ability to perform maximally is inhibited in the initial phase of the second half, which may be due to lower muscle temperatures compared with the end of the first half. Thus, when players perform low-intensity activities in the interval between the two halves, both muscle temperature and performance are preserved. Several studies have shown that fatigue sets in towards the end of a game, which may be caused by low glycogen concentrations in a considerable number of individual muscle fibres. In a hot and humid environment, dehydration and a reduced cerebral function may also contribute to the deterioration in performance.

Moreover, the mechanisms via which tumours resist anti-angiogenic therapies are poorly understood. Importantly, rather than utilizing angiogenesis, some metastases may instead incorporate pre-existing vessels from surrounding tissue (vessel co-option). As anti-angiogenic therapies were designed to target only new blood vessel growth, vessel co-option has been proposed as a mechanism that could drive resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy. However, vessel co-option has not been extensively studied in lung metastases, and its potential to mediate resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy in lung metastases is not established. Here, we examined the mechanism of tumour vascularization in 164 human lung metastasis specimens (composed of breast, colorectal and renal cancer lung metastasis cases). We identified four distinct histopathological growth patterns (HGPs) of lung metastasis (alveolar, interstitial, perivascular cuffing, and pushing), each of which vascularized via a different mechanism. In the alveolar HGP, cancer cells invaded the alveolar air spaces, facilitating the co-option of alveolar capillaries. In the interstitial HGP, cancer cells invaded the alveolar walls to co-opt alveolar capillaries. In the perivascular cuffing HGP, cancer cells grew by co-opting larger vessels of the lung. Only in the pushing HGP did the tumours vascularize by angiogenesis. Importantly, vessel co-option occurred with high frequency, being present in >80% of the cases examined. Moreover, we provide evidence that vessel co-option mediates resistance to the anti-angiogenic drug sunitinib in preclinical lung metastasis models. Assuming that our interpretation of the data is correct, we conclude that vessel co-option in lung metastases occurs through at least three distinct mechanisms, that vessel co-option occurs frequently in lung metastases, and that vessel co-option could mediate resistance to anti-angiogenic therapy in lung metastases. Novel therapies designed to target both angiogenesis and vessel co-option are therefore warranted. © 2016 The Authors.

Free a generated in the first step may serve as the amino donor in a subsequent reductive amination that is always catalysed by the AmDH. The second option (Scheme 2 B), which explains the formation of the enantiopure primary amine as a side product, predicts an unlikely promiscuous hydrolytic activity of AmDHs. In fact, a polarised water molecule in the active site of AmDH with appropriate orientation, may attack the sp3‐carbon atom in the α position to the nitrogen of the ketiminium intermediate (1 d* in the example). Although such a hydrolytic step is chemically unlikely, it cannot be excluded beforehand because of the particular catalytic environment in the active site of the AmDH, in which a polarised water molecule is normally involved in catalysis.17 If such a hydrolytic step occurred, subsequent hydride transfer from NADH would generate a primary amine. Furthermore, only in the case of cyclic intermediates such as 1 d*, would the same nucleophilic attack of a water molecule also provoke the opening of the cyclopropyl ring to give an aminol upon reduction (not depicted in Scheme 2 B). However, this route is also incompatible with the observed mixture of products. The third option (Scheme 2 C) is an unprecedented formal transamination reaction. In nature, transamination reactions are catalysed by pyridoxal 5′‐phosphate (PLP)‐dependent aminotransferase through a ping‐pong mechanism.19 However, an alternative NAD+/NADH redox‐mediated mechanism is conceivable. According to this hypothesis, the key catalytic step would be the isomerisation of the ketiminium intermediate (1 d* in Scheme 2 C) through the action of NAD+/NADH, to give the other ketiminium intermediate 1 d**.", "pmid": "30489013", "journal_title": "N/A", "PubDate_year": null, "PubDate_month": null, "PubDate_date": null}, {"rank": 7, "score": 64.993095, "title": "Microscopic Diffusion\nof Atomic Hydrogen and Water\nin HER Catalyst MoS2 Revealed by Neutron Scattering", "text": "Given the above results, we propose two possible scenarios\nfor\nthe translational diffusion of hydrogen in H2O/MoS2.

Among these treatment modalities, an anti-thyroid agent, methimazole (MMI), is the most widely used option for the initial treatment of Graves’ disease, because of its efficacy, convenience and low cost. However, thyroidectomy should be considered for patients with large thyroid glands, especially when anti-thyroid agents are not effective or tolerated. However, the patient’s hyperthyroidism should be adequately controlled before they undergo thyroidectomy; otherwise, the risk of thyroid storm during the perioperative period is higher. Furthermore, no definitive guidelines exist regarding the preoperative management for patients with Graves’ disease with severe hyperthyroidism because of resistance to MMI.", "pmid": "33682498", "journal_title": "N/A", "PubDate_year": null, "PubDate_month": null, "PubDate_date": null}, {"rank": 3, "score": 78.17134, "title": "Non–Small Cell Lung Cancer Patient Preferences for First-Line\nTreatment: A Discrete Choice Experiment", "text": "The experiment was designed and D-efficiency was estimated using the R routine\nDesign of Experiments.

Toxic nodular goitres cause hyperthyroidism due to autonomous hyperfunctioning of localised areas of the thyroid. There are 3 recognised modalities of treatment for hyperthyroidism: antithyroid drugs, surgery and radioiodine. All are effective but no single method offers an absolute cure. Patients with Graves' disease may be prescribed antithyroid drugs over a period of 12 to 18 months with a view to inducing a long term remission. These drugs are also often given for a short period to render the patient euthyroid before definitive therapy with radioiodine or thyroidectomy. However, antithyroid drugs will not 'cure' hyperthyroidism associated with a toxic nodular goitre. The use of radioiodine as a first-line therapy for hyperthyroidism is growing. It is well tolerated, with the only long term sequelae being the risk of developing radioiodine-induced hypothyroidism. Radioiodine can be used in all age groups other than children, although it should also be avoided in pregnancy and during lactation. Pregnancy should be avoided for 4 months following its administration. Radioiodine may cause a deterioration in Graves' ophthalmopathy and corticosteroid cover may reduce the risk of this complication. The treatment of choice for toxic nodular goitre hyperthyroidism is radioiodine. Surgery, either subtotal or near-total thyroidectomy, has limited but specific roles to play in the treatment of hyperthyroidism: this approach is rarely used in patients with Graves' disease unless radioiodine has been refused or there is a large goitre causing symptoms of compression in the neck.

These reducing equivalents generate ATP after transversing through a series of reactions in the mitochondrial complexes through the electron transport chain (ETC) located in the inner mitochondrial membrane through the process of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) (Figure 2).", "pmid": "33488105", "journal_title": "N/A", "PubDate_year": null, "PubDate_month": null, "PubDate_date": null}, {"rank": 2, "score": 68.57863, "title": "Oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage and neurodegenerative diseases", "text": "Structurally, mitochondria have four compartments: the outer membrane, the inner membrane, the intermembrane space, and the matrix (the region inside the inner membrane)[]. The porous outer membrane encompasses the whole organelle and contains many important enzymes and receptors[], and is freely permeable to small molecules and ions. The convoluted and invaginated inner membrane contains the enzymes of oxidative phosphorylation: cofactor coenzyme Q (ubiquinone Q), F0F1-adenosine triphosphate synthase, and some carrier proteins[]. In addition, cardiolipin is an important component of the inner mitochondrial membrane, which is impermeable to most small molecules and ions, including H+[]. Between the inner and outer membrane is the intermembrane space, with contains specialized proteins[]. In the matrix, bordered by the inner membrane, there are many enzymes for different metabolic pathways, including the citric acid cycle, fatty acid oxidation and urea cycle, mitochondrial DNA synthesis, and peptidases and chaperones[]. Mitochondria perform numerous tasks, with the most crucial probably being the generation of energy as adenosine triphosphate by means of the electron-transport chain and the oxidative phosphorylation system (respiratory chain)[]. In addition to adenosine triphosphate synthesis, mitochondria can accumulate Ca2+. Changes in mitochondrial Ca2+ can regulate tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes[]. Through the adenosine triphosphate/adenosine diphosphate pool, mitochondria can influence glycolysis, the activity of Ca2+ and Na+-K+-adenosine triphosphate synthases at the plasma membrane and consequently the activity of Na+-coupled plasma membrane transporters[]. Each mammalian mitochondrion contains 2–10 copies of mitochondrial DNA, resulting in 1 000–100 000 copies in each human cell. Individual mitochondrial DNA molecules replicate at random, making one or more copies at a time while maintaining a relatively constant total number of mitochondrial DNA molecules within the cell. If there are two or more different types of mitochondrial DNA molecules within a cell, by chance, any one type of molecule may replicate more frequently than another type, resulting in a change in the level of heteroplasmy within the cell (intracellular drift)[]. The number of organelles varies among cells, depending in large part on the metabolic requirements of that cell. Thus, skin fibroblasts contain a few hundred mitochondria, whereas neurons may contain thousands, and cardiomyocytes tens of thousands[].

A qualitative multi-case study design was applied. Data were collected through site visits to 4 heath centres (2 low- and 2-high performing centres). We interviewed 18 support providers and recipients between October 2014 and October 2015. Data were analysed using content, thematic, and cross-case analysis. Four categories of strategies were used to support Option B+ guidelines implementation: training, technical assistance (TA), tools, and resources. All heath-centres implemented Option B+ guidelines for care provided between the antenatal and labor and delivery periods. Gaps in Option B+ implementation occurred during community activities and during post-delivery care, including gaps in testing of children to ascertain their HIV status at 6 weeks, 12 months, and 24 months. Salient contextual factors included staffing shortages, transportation challenges, limited space and infrastructure, limited stocks of HIV testing kits, and large patient populations. Understanding factors that influence implementation support strategies and delivery of the Option B+ guidelines, such as availability of staff and other materials/drug resources, is critical to designing effective implementation support for low resource settings.", "pmid": "", "journal_title": "N/A", "PubDate_year": null, "PubDate_month": null, "PubDate_date": null}]}

Generally, CMV isolates that harbor UL97 gene mutations remain susceptible to foscarnet and cidofovir. However, isolates with UL54 gene mutations are more likely to confer cross-resistance to cidofovir. Therefore, foscarnet is recommended as the first option for empirical treatment of suspected ganciclovir-resistant CMV diseases. However, a disadvantage of this option is its potential nephrotoxicity, which requires close monitoring of fluid and electrolytes. Previous studies have demonstrated that dose escalation of ganciclovir (up to 7.5–10 mg/kg twice daily) is also an appealing option to avoid adverse effects associated with foscarnet]. In the absence of UL54 gene mutations, cidofovir is another therapeutic option for drug-resistant CMV, but nephrotoxicity is also a concern.

From the above analysis, we come to a conclusion that there could be symmetric Tau and dp/dt, which reveals the symmetry exists between isovolumic contraction and isovolumic relaxation. It deserves to mention that during isovolumic periods, both the aortic and mitral valve are closed, which makes it the best time to evaluate cardiac function due to relative independence of foreload and afterload. The next comes the systolic ejection phase and the diastolic rapid inflow phase. Since the active cardiac muscle movement is still a driving force of these periods, especially in the early stage of the phase, symmetry should still apply. For example, the color M-mode flow propagation velocity could be measured in both phases. In the late stage of the phases, the active systolic contraction/diastolic relaxation comes to an end, which shows that the symmetry is ready to phase out. This is for systolic and diastolic symmetry of Tei index. Further investigation is needed to determine how much the symmetry principle is applied here.

Metabolites play a useful role in communicating the extent of ATP demand to the metabolic supply pathways. During fatigue from high-intensity exercise, a major change in the intracellular milieu of skeletal muscle is not ATP depletion but metabolite accumulation that affects the actomyosin cross-bridge interaction. The resulting reduction in myosin ATPase activity, cross-bridge turnover rate, and velocity of contraction can be considered a useful downregulation of ATP demand. Although maximal force is reduced, it is reduced less than myosin ATPase activity. In combination, efficiency of force production at the cross-bridge is thus enhanced. This is a second useful role for metabolites during fatigue because the total ATP cost per unit of force is partially reduced. Theoretical models predict that ADP may alleviate some effects of fatigue by further enhancing cross-bridge efficiency, thus providing a third useful role for metabolite accumulation. Recent experimental evidence reviewed here suggests that this occurs when ATP concentration is dramatically reduced. Single-fiber chemical analyses of fatigued muscle show lower ATP concentrations than other methods, but whether the appropriate microenvironments for effective competition by ADP for the nucleotide binding site occur around some or all of the cross-bridges remains technically difficult to prove at this time. During fatigue, muscle activation is also decreased, a response that potentially has the greatest effect on ATP demand-supply matching. I propose that the mismatch between the expected force production relative to muscle activation and the reduced force production from inorganic phosphate accumulation is the peripheral signal for reduced activation and is therefore the fourth useful role of metabolites in alleviating fatigue.", "pmid": "", "journal_title": "Cancer genetics and cytogenetics", "PubDate_year": null, "PubDate_month": null, "PubDate_date": null}, {"rank": 2, "score": 68.52073, "title": "Mitochondrial bioenergetics and D-ribose in HFpEF: a brief narrative review", "text": "HFpEF is a debilitating disease with few effective medical treatment options for patients.

The security of the pouch seal is the key to preventing leakage, which, in turn, can prevent peristomal skin irritation. Evidence supporting the benefit of an intervention that promotes adhesion of the skin barrier and a secure pouch seal provides the clinician with an additional option to offer to those who have an ostomy. The ostomy support belt/garment's design (a compartment in which the pouch fits, thus providing support) may be a contributor to a reduction in leakage and peristomal skin irritation frequencies. Overall, the results from this study indicate the use of an ostomy support belt/garment may reduce ostomy complications and improve QOL.", "pmid": "35040815", "journal_title": "N/A", "PubDate_year": null, "PubDate_month": null, "PubDate_date": null}, {"rank": 2, "score": 85.37792, "title": "Peristomal Moisture-Associated Skin Damage and Independence in Pouching System Changes in Persons With New Fecal Ostomies", "text": "Peristomal moisture-associated dermatitis was defined as inflammation and denudation of skin adjacent to a stoma associated with exposure to effluent, such as urine or stool.Independence when changing a pouching system was defined as demonstrating competence in changing and caring for a pouching system.

The peristomal body profile should be assessed for uneven profiles such as the area pulling inward, concavity around the stoma, scars, creases, and whether the peristomal abdomen is soft or firm with gentle palpation. Another indication for the use of convexity is the location of the stoma lumen or os. If the os is below or even with the skin, effluent may undermine the seal and can cause leakage; convexity may be selected to direct the stoma effluent into the pouch, preventing undermining or leakage. Panelists also agreed that a pouching system belt can be used to stabilize the pouch seal and convexity.

This is important, because it allows for surgical options in the event that we cannot secure wire access from the left common carotid or left subclavian artery. Once the innominate is stented, we always have the option to perform open debranch of the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries as needed.

They rely on oxygen‐dependent resynthesis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which requires both adequate delivery of oxygen to the mitochondria and the availability of carbohydrate (CHO) and lipid fuels (Joyner & Coyle, 2008). Competitive success is awarded to athletes who sustain the highest power outputs/speeds for the duration of their event. Indeed, race pace in many endurance events (e.g. the marathon, cycling time trials, cross‐country skiing events) involves a very high percentage of an individual's maximal aerobic intensity (Joyner et al. 2011; Tucker, 2016; Burke et al. 2019). In longer events of lower ‘background’ intensity (e.g. Ironman triathlon, cycling road races and stage races), tactical, terrain and pacing characteristics require bursts of activity at or above critical velocity (Fernandez‐Garcia et al. 2000; Bentley et al. 2002; Tucker, 2016). Even when such pieces (e.g. breakaways, hill climbs, surges, sprint finishes) make a small contribution to overall energy costs, they are critical to the event outcome. Key characteristics of elite endurance athletes, accrued via genetics and training, involve the interaction of high peak aerobic capacity (), high muscle oxidative capacity and high exercise economy (Joyner & Coyle, 2008).

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is the cellular currency for energy-requiring processes including mechanical work (i.e., exercise). ATP used by the cells is ultimately derived from the catabolism of energy substrate molecules-carbohydrates, fat, and protein. In prolonged moderate to high-intensity exercise, there is a delicate interplay between carbohydrate and fat metabolism, and this bioenergetic process is tightly regulated by numerous physiological, nutritional, and environmental factors such as exercise intensity and duration, body mass and feeding state. Carbohydrate metabolism is of critical importance during prolonged endurance-type exercise, reflecting the physiological need to regulate glucose homeostasis, assuring optimal glycogen storage, proper muscle fuelling, and delaying the onset of fatigue. Fat metabolism represents a sustainable source of energy to meet energy demands and preserve the 'limited' carbohydrate stores. Coordinated neural, hormonal and circulatory events occur during prolonged endurance-type exercise, facilitating the delivery of fatty acids from adipose tissue to the working muscle for oxidation. However, with increasing exercise intensity, fat oxidation declines and is unable to supply ATP at the rate of the exercise demand. Protein is considered a subsidiary source of energy supporting carbohydrates and fat metabolism, contributing to approximately 10% of total ATP turnover during prolonged endurance-type exercise.

When the muscle cannot use enough oxygen for aerobic glycolysis at high-exercise intensities, anaerobic glycolysis produces ATP in the cytosol of the muscle by the incomplete breakdown of glucose into lactate [].

Once in the bloodstream, lactate can be taken up by exercising or non-exercising skeletal muscles, kidney, or liver, where it is converted to pyruvate for gluconeogenesis []. Concurrently, when muscles degrade amino acids for energy needs, the resulting nitrogen is transaminated to pyruvate to produce alanine. This alanine is transported to the liver, where nitrogen enters the urea cycle and pyruvate is used to produce glucose [].

Glutamine is considered important for the maintenance of the renal tubules, contributing to the healthy functioning of the kidneys.

Extension of the terminal phalynx of the thumb resulted in both short latency and long latency facilitations of individual FPL motoneurones. These were not reproduced by electrical stimulation of afferents in the terminal phalynx. Magnetic stimulation over the contralateral motor cortex produced strong, short latency facilitation of FPL motoneurones. 4. When the facilitation produced by stimulation over the cortex was superimposed on the long latency facilitation produced by extension of the thumb, the facilitation produced by both stimuli was greater than the sum of the individual facilitations produced by either stimulus given alone. This was not the case when the superimposition occurred on the short latency response to stretch. 5.

Strategies are needed to improve the uptake of these guidelines to prevent avoidable new HIV infections of infants. In 2010 the World Health Organisation presented its new PMTCT guidelines, offering two options for short courses of antiretroviral prophylaxis: Option A and Option B. Option A consists of antenatal prophylaxis with zidovudine followed by intrapartum and postpartum prophylaxis with single-dose nevirapine and zidovudine plus lamivudine. Option B recommends triple antiretroviral prophylaxis until after finishing breastfeeding. Tanzania has adopted Option A, and it is currently implementing it. A new option termed Option B+ has emerged recently, which recommends providing lifelong antiretroviral treatment to all HIV-positive pregnant women. In this article, we discuss the likely impact of this last PMTCT strategy in rural Africa with an example of an observational cross-sectional analysis in a rural referral hospital in Tanzania aiming to assess the uptake of PMTCT recommendations. Gaps were identified at all steps of the PMTCT pathway. Effective uptake of PMTCT guidelines has been shown to be extremely challenging in this setting. The continuously changing recommendations on PMTCT stress the need for a much simpler and effective approach. We argue in favour of implementing Option B+ in Tanzania. Financial challenges need to be faced, but Option B+ would help to overcome many barriers that prevent guidelines to be implemented in order to increase coverage and ultimately achieve the goal of 'virtual elimination' of mother-to-child transmission in sub-Saharan Africa.", "pmid": "", "journal_title": "Experimental neurology", "PubDate_year": null, "PubDate_month": null, "PubDate_date": null}]}

By way of a demonstration, a variety of scenarios were presented to illustrate how examination length and the number of response options impact examinees’ chances of passing a given examination, and how subsequent cut-score decisions may be impacted by these factors.\n As a general rule, classroom assessments containing fewer items should utilize traditional 4-option or 5-option responses, whereas assessments of greater length are afforded greater flexibility in potentially utilizing 3-option responses.\n More research on items with 3-option responses is needed to better understand what value, if any, 3-option responses truly add to classroom assessments, and in what contexts potential benefits might be discernible.\n", "pmid": "28367465", "journal_title": "N/A", "PubDate_year": null, "PubDate_month": null, "PubDate_date": null}, {"rank": 10, "score": 63.431328, "title": "Lateral nasal advancement flap for reconstruction of the nasal sidewall and dorsum", "text": "If an adequate length of the Burow’s base is obtained and cases are selected properly, this flap will be available for young patients.

Based on these results, two options arise for explaining the significantly reduced glycogen synthesis rate in subjects with type 2 diabetes relative to healthy controls: First, type 2 diabetes is characterized by a reduction in the amount of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) per cell surface area, or second, a change in the three-dimensional (3D) structure of GLUT4, which affects the amount of transmembrane glucose-transport.

An expression profile in men and women for a representative X chromosome escapee gene (KDM6A) is shown in Figure 3. The corresponding mouse gene (Kdm6a) exhibits increased expression levels in XX compared to XY FCG mice, showing that this effect is determined by sex chromosome complement rather than gonadal hormones (Figure 3). It is estimated that 3–6% of mouse X chromosome genes escape inactivation, and these same genes plus others (approximately 15% of X chromosome genes) escape inactivation in humans. Some X escapee genes have partner genes that were retained on the Y chromosome, and escape from inactivation may help normalize expression of these genes between XX and XY cells. However, many more X chromosome genes escape inactivation than have partners on the Y chromosome. The X escapee genes encode proteins that may influence gene expression broadly, including histone modifying enzymes, translation initiation proteins, and RNA helicases, to name a few. Differences also exist between XX and XY cells due to parent-of-origin imprinting. Genomic imprinting is the heritable DNA or histone methylation at specific regions of chromosomes that leads to transcriptional silencing. Imprints are established in the germline of the mother or father and passed to offspring such that the allele from only one parent will be expressed in the offspring. XX cells receive an X chromosome from both father and mother, whereas an XY cell receives an X exclusively from the mother. Thus, only XX cells undergo paternal X chromosome imprinting, which can lead to differences in gene expression in XX compared to XY cells.

The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared to a manually annotated reference scoring (RS). Based on visual representations and audible playback of Korotkoff sounds, the creation of the RS involved two experts identifying sections of the recorded sounds and annotating sections of noise contamination. The experts determined the systolic and diastolic pressure in 100 recorded Korotkoff sound recordings, using a simultaneous electrocardiograph as a reference signal. The recorded Korotkoff sounds were acquired from 25 healthy subjects (16 men and 9 women) with a total of four measurements per subject. Two of these measurements contained purposely induced noise artifact caused by subject movement. Morphological changes in the cuff pressure signal and the width of the Korotkoff pulse were extracted features which were believed to be correlated with the noise presence in the recorded Korotkoff sounds. Verification of reliable Korotkoff pulses was also performed using extracted features from the oscillometric waveform as recorded from the inflatable cuff. The time between an identified noise section and a verified Korotkoff pulse was the key feature used to determine the validity of possible systolic and diastolic pressures in noise contaminated Korotkoff sounds.

Although, under all treatment regimes (Option A, Option B and Option B+) treatment is initiated during pregnancy, Option B+ is unique in that treatment is continued after pregnancy ends irrespective of the woman's CD4 cell count. This means that women who would not receive ART if they had never been pregnant were now receiving ART purely because they had once been pregnant.

The essential characteristic of our weaning concept includes the repeated determination of the spontaneous breathing frequency in awake patients, which is followed by controlled intermittent positive pressure ventilation with a slightly higher respiratory rate. Ideally, this results in total suppression of the activity of the breathing centre, and in subsequent relief and recovery of the respiratory muscles by replenishing the energy stores. The close succession of relief and training periods avoids inactivity-induced atrophy of the respiratory muscles and permits regeneration. Additionally, our weaning concept avoids increases in inspiratory work during the phases of spontaneous breathing. This means that high-resistance small-caliber endotracheal tubes have to be replaced by large tubes. Moreover, transtracheal oxygen insufflation during spontaneous breathing decreases anatomic dead space. This reduces minute ventilation and, therefore, the work of breathing. In patients still exhibiting chronic fatigue of the respiratory muscle pump after successful weaning, intermittent home ventilation is initiated via a breathing mask. Apart from the concept described above, successful weaning from the respirator after long-term ventilation is based upon dedicated patient care and depends on the architectural characteristics of the intensive care unit.", "pmid": "", "journal_title": "The International journal of eating disorders", "PubDate_year": null, "PubDate_month": null, "PubDate_date": null}, {"rank": 5, "score": 77.777466, "title": "A 3‐year‐old boy with rapid obstructive symptoms secondary to coin ingestion and gastric impaction", "text": "On arrival to the initial ED, ≈30 minutes after the ingestion, the patient was well, appearing without stridor, drooling, or increased work of breathing.

Strategies are needed to improve the uptake of these guidelines to prevent avoidable new HIV infections of infants. In 2010 the World Health Organisation presented its new PMTCT guidelines, offering two options for short courses of antiretroviral prophylaxis: Option A and Option B. Option A consists of antenatal prophylaxis with zidovudine followed by intrapartum and postpartum prophylaxis with single-dose nevirapine and zidovudine plus lamivudine. Option B recommends triple antiretroviral prophylaxis until after finishing breastfeeding. Tanzania has adopted Option A, and it is currently implementing it. A new option termed Option B+ has emerged recently, which recommends providing lifelong antiretroviral treatment to all HIV-positive pregnant women. In this article, we discuss the likely impact of this last PMTCT strategy in rural Africa with an example of an observational cross-sectional analysis in a rural referral hospital in Tanzania aiming to assess the uptake of PMTCT recommendations. Gaps were identified at all steps of the PMTCT pathway. Effective uptake of PMTCT guidelines has been shown to be extremely challenging in this setting. The continuously changing recommendations on PMTCT stress the need for a much simpler and effective approach. We argue in favour of implementing Option B+ in Tanzania.

Specifically, electrons are transferred from NADH to oxygen through a chain of electron carriers collectively called the electron transport chain (ETC). The four major protein complexes located in the IMM within the ETC are NADH-Q reductase (complex I), succinate-Q reductase (complex II), Q-cytochrome c reductase (complex III) and cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV). Complexes I, III and IV pump H+ ions into the mitochondrial intermembranous space from the mitochondrial matrix to produce a gradient of H+ ions when electrons are transported down the ETC.

Subsequently, protons flow back into the mitochondrial matrix via ATP synthase, also called complex V, to produce ATP.

PK mainly catalyses the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and ADP to pyruvate and ATP in glycolysis; PK is the key enzyme for regulation of the conversion of glucose to pyruvate. Four subtypes of PK are expressed in mammalian cells, including M1, M2, L and R. PKM2 is the major isoform expressed in proliferating cells that plays the key role in the biosynthetic pathway leading from glucose to the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and to biosynthesis of serine and nucleotides. Recent studies have shown that PKM2 acts as a glycolytic kinase in the cytoplasm and functions as a protein kinase in the nucleus; the expression level of PKM2 is related to cell proliferation. PDHα catalyses the production of acetyl-CoA from pyruvate, which enters the TCA cycle and mitochondrial respiratory chain to produce energy; PDK1 inhibits PDHα activity and hinders participation of mitochondrial pyruvate in the TCA cycle; PYC2 mediates carboxylation of pyruvate to form oxaloacetate by biotin-dependent catalysis; subsequently, oxaloacetate enters the TCA cycle or is used for synthesis of biomacromolecules. The PYC2 overexpression strategy has been applied to several industrially relevant mammalian cells and has been demonstrated to be beneficial for nutrient utilization or growth. Recent studies have shown that overexpression of PYC2 in CHO cells prolongs the lifespan and reduces the ratio of lactate to glucose by 25%. Furthermore, HEK-293 cells overexpressing PYC2 are characterized by highly efficient metabolism due to reduced glucose and glutamine consumption and by reduced accumulation of ammonia and lactate in the batch culture. The three enzymes, including PDHα, PDK1 and PYC2, are the key regulators of pyruvate entrance in the TCA cycle; LDHA catalyses the conversion of pyruvate to lactate. Inhibition of LDHA activity improved cell growth and respiration rate in CHO cells. MPC plays the key role in controlling the cell metabolism at the pyruvate branching sites. MPC transports pyruvate from the cytoplasm to the mitochondrial matrix thus correlating glycolysis with mitochondrial metabolism. The MPC1 subunit plays the major role in mammalian cells (no further in-depth studies are available due to inability to obtain stable transfected cell lines). Yeast cells can express three subunits, including MPC1, MPC2 and MPC3. MPC3 shares 71% amino acid sequence identity with MPC2 and induces the expression of MPC to transfer pyruvate into the mitochondria during cell growth using a carbon source. Aralar1 is the critical enzyme in the malate-aspartate NADH shuttle (MAS), which mainly regulates the transport of NADH in vitro and in vivo and the transport of pyruvate to the mitochondria. Glycolytic metabolic flux and pyruvate and lactate metabolism are influenced by the NADH shuttle pathway. The rate of glycolytic metabolism depends on the rate of NADH-dependent reduction of pyruvate to lactate and the NADH shuttle pathway to regenerate NAD+. The rate of pyruvate conversion to the mitochondrial TCA cycle is comparable to the rate of NADH transport to the mitochondria via the NADH shuttle pathway at a steady state. Consequently, an increase in the flux of NADH into the mitochondria will enhance the flux of pyruvate into mitochondria.

Recent studies have indicated that fentanyl patch is an effective tool for the management of pain associated with oral mucositis caused by chemotherapy and is also a noninvasive application compared to injections, especially in immunosuppressed patients]. However, the lowest-dose fentanyl patch that can be used is 12 µg/h, which is equivalent to 10 mg morphine injection. Therefore, if the 24 hr dosage of short-acting medication is <10 mg morphine injection, the use of a fentanyl patch will be considered an inappropriate converted dosage in all cases. For appropriate pain management in patients who cannot swallow tablets and require <10 mg morphine, a non-oral sustained-release medication with dosage lower than fentanyl 12 µg/h is required. Among opioid analgesics commercially available in Korea, the buprenorphine patch is a partial agonist of the m opioid receptor, and its lowest available dosage is 5 µg/h, which corresponds to 5 mg morphine injection. Thus, this patch is an effective and safe method for pain management in patients who require relatively low-dose analgesics but have difficulties in swallowing tablets]. However, in Korea, the use of the buprenorphine patch was approved only for relief from moderate to severe chronic pain that does not respond to non-opioid analgesics, and thus its use in HSCT patients will likely be limited []. Therefore, the guidelines should be changed to recommend IV injection of an appropriate dose of morphine over a 24 hr period in patients receiving sustained-release medication that exceeds the recommended short-acting medication dose. Alternatively, if injection is not an option and fentanyl patches must be used, active monitoring against possible side effects (i.e., sedation/drowsiness, delirium from sudden increase, diarrhea, nausea/vomiting, and other neurological side effects from high dose administration) is required [].

In moderate pain, oral morphine immediate release can be initiated at 5 mg Q4H after monitoring the renal functions.

In severe pain, oral morphine immediate release can be started at 10 mg Q4H, and if the patient is unable to take orally, inj morphine 2–2.5 mg can be initiated Q4H SC or IV.

This article examines pain management in the palliative care setting, based on a review of the literature using the standard Prescrire methodology. Accurate pain evaluation, preferably by the patient, is essential for guiding treatment decisions. Some causes of pain are amenable to specific treatments. The expected benefits and harms of the various treatment options and procedures must be weighed on a case by case basis. Quality of life should always be the first priority. The World Health Organization has developed a \"three-step analgesic ladder\", based on the use of increasingly potent analgesics: step I analgesics include paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs); codeine is the standard step II analgesic; and morphine is the standard step III analgesic. Fentanyl is an alternative to morphine. The daily morphine dose must be determined for each patient. Morphine titration starts with oral doses given every 4 hours, but additional doses can be taken every hour if necessary. Total consumption is then used to calculate the dose required the following day. A sustained-release product can be used to reduce the number of doses required when a consistently effective daily dose has been established. When patients are unable to take morphine orally, it can be given by subcutaneous injection, and by subcutaneous or intravenous infusion. Pumps allow the patient to self-administer morphine on demand. Fentanyl transdermal patches are another option for stable pain. Immediate-release oral forms and injections are useful for preventing or treating breakthrough pain. If morphine requirements increase during treatment, the most likely explanations are exacerbations of pain or an excessively long interval between doses. Pharmacological tolerance and psychological dependence are rare during palliative care. In case of renal failure, the morphine dose should be reduced, sustained-release morphine should be replaced by immediate-release morphine, or morphine should be replaced by fentanyl, as fentanyl metabolism is only slightly affected by renal function. The main adverse effects of morphine are constipation, nausea and vomiting. Drowsiness is frequent at initiation of treatment. Respiratory depression is rare when morphine is introduced gradually. Tricyclic antidepressants and carbamazepine have acceptable harm-benefit balances in patients with neuropathic pain. Cannabinoids are another option but have not been adequately assessed. Localised refractory pain may respond to local anaesthesia, chemical neurolysis or surgical ablation. In practice, it is best to allow patients to control their own analgesic consumption, within limits set by their physician to prevent dosing errors.", "pmid": "", "journal_title": "Current opinion in critical care", "PubDate_year": null, "PubDate_month": null, "PubDate_date": null}, {"rank": 7, "score": 79.00517, "title": "Evaluation of opioid consumption trends for pain in Taiwan and comparison with neighboring Asian countries", "text": "Figure 1A shows the trends of opioid consumption in Taiwan, including fentanyl, morphine, oxycodone, hydromorphone, codeine, and pethidine, from 2008 to 2018.

In skeletal muscle, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) is the primary regulator of calcium storage, release, and reuptake, while glycolysis and the mitochondria are responsible for cellular ATP production.

Close spatial Ca2+/ATP/ROS/RNS communication between the SR and mitochondria is facilitated by the structural attachment of mitochondria to the calcium release unit (CRU) by 10 nm of electron-dense tethers.

Sarcomeres have a complicated structure with the main force-generating unit consisting of actin, myosin, and multiple regulatory proteins (such as troponin and tropomyosin). The myosin complex consists of two myosin heavy chains and two pairs of myosin light chains. The myosin heavy chain has a globular head that has an ATPase domain (which cleaves ATP to produce energy), as well as an actin-binding site, through which the contractile force is transduced. Cardiac troponin (cTn) and tropomyosin form a complex that regulates the interaction of myosin with actin in a calcium sensitive manner []. In the resting state, there are low calcium concentrations in the myocyte, and the troponin–tropomyosin complex blocks cross-bridge formation between actin and myosin. Depolarization of the myocyte triggers calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, increasing sarcomeric concentrations of calcium, resulting in calcium binding to cTnC and a shift of tropomyosin so that it no longer blocks actin–myosin cross-bridge formation. Subsequently, myosin binds to actin and, from energy released through the hydrolysis of ATP to ADP, produces a force-generating conformational change and shortening of the sarcomere.

Fractures in this patient population are generally lower-energy injuries than seen in younger patients. Due to poor bone quality, fracture patterns are often complex with significant displacement and damage to the articular surface. As such, there is an association between patient age and failure of fracture fixation. Patients older than 60 have an increased risk of fixation failure and radiographic evidence of osteoporosis is a major predictor of failed fixation. One study reported a 79% rate of radiographic fixation failure in elderly patients vs 7% in the younger group of patients[].

Three sizes of tracheostomy tubes with the two cuff types were placed in appropriately sized tracheal models and lateral wall pressure was measured via pressure-sensing elements on the inner surface. Fluid sealing performance was assessed by inflating the cuffs within the tracheal models (25 cmH2O), instilling water above the cuff, and measuring fluid leakage past the cuff. To measure air leak, tubes were attached to a test lung and ventilator, and leak was calculated by subtracting the average exhaled tidal volume from the average delivered tidal volume.

The maximally bridged ring of the arcutane framework (see emphasis in Fig. 2A) was identified as a central six-membered primary ring containing 4 bridging atoms in the diterpenoid scaffold and 6 bridging atoms in the arcutane alkaloids, which contain an additional pyrrolidine ring.

First is a two-bond disconnection across either the C (purple bonds), D (red bonds), or the maximally bridged E (in the case of atropurpuran) rings, which would lead directly back to an all fused precursor containing no bridging elements (option 1, Fig. 2B).

Glycolysis is the primary metabolic pathway in the cytoplasm that converts glucose to two pyruvate molecules. This process releases two ATP and two reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) molecules. Pyruvate is then transported to the mitochondria and is converted to an acetyl group that comes along with coenzyme A to form the acetyl-CoA complex. Acetyl-CoA then joins the Krebs cycle in the mitochondrial matrix. The net result is one ATP, three NADH and one reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2). The electron transport chains (I, II, III, IV) are electron transporters inserted into the inner mitochondrial membrane that transport electrons from NADH and FADH2 to oxygen. In the pathway, protons are impelled from the mitochondrial matrix to the intermembrane space, and oxygen is the final acceptor for conversion to water molecules. Regarding oxygen reduction, ROS are produced in complex I, II, and III. The energy is deposited in the form of a proton gradient between the intermembrane space and matrix, and the energy will finally be converted to ATP. The completed process results in the yield of 36 ATP molecules. However, under conditions where oxygen is limited, glucose undergoes anaerobic metabolism, which is the partial oxidation of glucose to pyruvate, and is reduced to lactate (in human) or alcohol (in bacteria). NADH becomes oxidized, and 1-NAD+ is regenerated for glycolysis. Only two ATP molecules are yielded in anaerobic metabolism. Interestingly, the Warburg effect results in atypical metabolism, indicating that cancer cells mostly convert glucose into lactate even in the presence of oxygen. This characteristic is shared with normal proliferating cells. The net energy yield in anaerobic glycolysis is two ATP molecules, whereas the yield in oxidative phosphorylation is thirty-six. This observation leads to the paradox: why is the pathway that produces less ATP selected in such high-demand cells and is the Warburg effect the consequence of genetic changes in cancer or the cause of cancer? As mentioned above, a very common characteristic of cancer cells described by Otto Warburg is that the cancer cell exhibits increased glycolytic metabolism compared with normal cells. Using the dbEST database for the expression of genes and expressed sequence tags [U.S. NCBI, National Institutes of Health, it was found that genes involved in glycolysis are overexpressed in 24 different types of cancers, representing more than 70% of all human cancer cases. Although the key factors/pathways underlying the cancer metabolic phenotype remain to be elucidated, several mechanisms have been proposed base on the epigenetic changes in proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in the multistep process of carcinogenesis. In this session, we classified those mechanisms into 4 types: 1) mitochondrial changes—defect in oxidative phosphorylation, 2) changes in the metabolome or metabolite pools that facilitate glycolytic flux, 3) hypoxia-induced switch from oxidative mitochondrial respiration to glycolysis and 4) coordinated regulation of proteins that control glycolytic flux.", "pmid": "27437085", "journal_title": "N/A", "PubDate_year": null, "PubDate_month": null, "PubDate_date": null}, {"rank": 6, "score": 94.99029, "title": "Metabolic-epigenetic nexus in regulation of stem cell fate", "text": "Glycolysis is defined as a cytosolic redox reaction that transform a single glucose molecule into two pyruvate molecules accompanied by generation of two net ATP and two reduced NADH molecules.

These include the dose of paracetamol ingested, time to presentation, decreased liver glutathione, and induction of cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes responsible for the metabolism of paracetamol to its toxic metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine (NAPQI). In this paper, we review the currently published literature to determine whether induction of relevant CYP isoenzymes is a risk factor for hepatotoxicity in patients with acute paracetamol overdose. Animal and human in vitro studies have shown that the CYP isoenzyme responsible for the majority of human biotransformation of paracetamol to NAPQI is CYP2E1 at both therapeutic and toxic doses of paracetamol.

If the conditions are the same, the calculation results in this work are virtually equal to [], with a relative error of lower than 3%. The mean distribution trends of different models are basically the same. The larger radius, the smaller difference in calculation results. It is clear from fig. 4 (b) that the two groups of models ‘dna’ and ‘option 2’ as well as ‘option 4’ and ‘option 5’ are in good agreement with each other whether the elastic scattering or vibrational excitation and attachment are considered. It is verified that the basic cross section models used by the two groups of models respectively are consistent.

In the case of considering elastic scattering, frequency mean lineal energy of ‘option 2’ and ‘option 4’ are lower than ‘option 6’, because there is not loss energy during the elastic scattering of ‘option 2’ and ‘option 4’, while the elastic scattering process is accompanied by a very small kinetic energy loss (the average deposited energy is 0.0013 eV) in ‘option 6’. The mean values of ‘option 2’ and ‘option 4’ are also different because of their different elastic scattering cross section models: partial wave (PW) [] calculations for ‘option 2’, and screened Rutherford (SR) formula [] for ‘option 4’. When elastic scattering is not considered, except for the small radius of the site (1 nm), the frequency mean lineal energy of ‘option 6’ is significantly lower than those without removing the elastic scattering process.

We would like to remark the relevance of carefully analysing under which conditions a certain two‐stage fermentation process represents a viable option to pursue. Since PHB, one of the products obtainable from ethanol, was also produced from acetate in purposely engineered E. coli strains (Sun et al.,, we found it interesting to compare the hypothetical PHB yields that could be obtained assuming that the PHB bioprocessing step is in cascade to a CO2/H2 gas fermentation process producing solely acetate or ethanol. Since we found no evidence of the realization of a similar two‐stage process foreseeing ethanol as intermediate, we set out to rely on individual studies to obtain quantitative data separately on the single stages and to tentatively forecast the PHB yields in the hypothesized double‐stage processes. In particular, we extracted the data useful for quantifying PHB production from ethanol in ref. (Sun et al., and from acetate in ref. (Cestellos‐Blanco et al., and in ref. (Al Rowaihi et al.,. Similarly, we gathered quantitated information on acetate and ethanol production using acetogenic cultures grown on CO2‐H2 from ref. (Hermann et al.,. PHB derives from acetyl‐CoA by condensing two acetyl‐CoA molecules to one acetoacetyl‐CoA that is reduced and subsequently polymerized. Acetate and ethanol can be directly converted into acetyl‐CoA. Acetyl‐CoA is produced from acetate via two different pathways, which are catalysed, respectively, by the AMP‐forming acetyl‐CoA synthetase (ACS) and the phsphotransacetylase/acetate kinase (Pta‐AckA). Each of these routes consumes ATP for the production of acetyl‐CoA from acetate, and does not produce any reducing power, suggesting that additional acetate is required to generate ATP and reducing power when acetate is the sole carbon source. On the other hand, the transformation of ethanol into acetyl‐CoA generates two NADH per ethanol for ATP regeneration, which reduces the need of oxidizing acetyl‐CoA for harvesting energy and thus is expected to lead to higher yields of acetyl‐CoA‐derived chemicals such as PHB (Liang et al.,; Sun et al.,. Nonetheless, in the two‐stage scenario envisaged here, where ethanol or acetate are supposed to derive from a CO2/H2 gas fermentation bioprocess, we have to account for the fact that more hydrogen is required to reduce CO2 to ethanol than to acetate. Indeed, when we evaluated the hypothesized two‐stage processes, ethanol did not seem to outperform acetate as substrate for PHB production. As recapitulated in Table S1, the yields of PHB from H2 and CO2 when ethanol is the sole intermediate in the two‐stage process are comparable or slightly lower than the yields obtained when acetate is the sole intermediate (with slight variations depending on the study used to quantitate the PHB production from acetate).

Application of OSN requires high pressure; therefore, hollow fibre membranes with a high polymer concentration were fabricated with a sponge structure through liquid–liquid phase separation (Fig. 1(a) and (b)) (more details about the fabrication method of polyamide 6 hollow fibre membrane can be found in the Fig S1 and Table S1, ESI†). The hollow fibre membranes for OSN were fabricated with 30 wt% polymer and 70 wt% mixed diluent (DMSO2 and sulfolane). The sulfolane content in the diluent was fixed at 26 wt%. The content of sulfolane in the diluent also plays an important role in forming the skin layer of the membrane. When only DMSO2 is used as a diluent without any sulfolane, the resulting membrane is brittle because of the characteristics of DMSO2. DMSO2 cannot be extracted from hollow fibre membrane while spinning and winder process because the melting point of DMSO2 is around 109 °C which is solid state at room temperature as well as solubility is low in water. Therefore, sulfolane, which shows good solubility with polymers at high temperatures, was used as the second diluent. However, when the sulfolane content in the diluent is increased, pores are formed on the surface because the compatibility between sulfolane and PEG400 as the bore solution is higher than that between DMSO2 and PEG400. This phenomenon has been well explained in our previous paper. When polymer dope solution (polymer A/diluent B) (Fig. S2, ESI†) contacts with solution C (bore solution or quenching bath) in the TIPS process, two factors such as compatibility between polymer A and solution C, and compatibility between diluent B and solution C are important. As shown in Fig. S2,† when the compatibility between polymer A and solution C is higher than that of between diluent B and solution C, polymer is more likely to contact with solution C at the interface and thus dense polymer layer is formed at this interface.

A high lactate appearance rate (R(a), 184 +/- 17 micromol x kg(-1) x min(-1)) but a low arterial lactate concentration ( approximately 2.5 mmol/l) were observed during Continuous Arm + Leg despite a substantial net lactate release by the arm of approximately 2.1 mmol/min, which was balanced by a similar net lactate uptake by the leg.

Whole body glucose and glycerol turnover was unchanged during the different skiing modes; however, limb net glucose uptake changed severalfold. In conclusion, the arterial lactate concentration can be maintained at a relatively low level despite high lactate R(a) during exercise with a large muscle mass because of the large capacity of active skeletal muscle to take up lactate, which is tightly correlated with lactate delivery. The limb lactate uptake during exercise is oxidized at rates far above resting oxygen consumption, implying that lactate uptake and subsequent oxidation are also dependent on an elevated metabolic rate. The relative contribution of whole body and limb lactate oxidation is between 20 and 30% of total carbohydrate oxidation at rest and during exercise under the various conditions.

The pain stimulus is further processed and modulated in specific pain centres in the brain, which may undergo plastic alterations. Hence, tissue inflammation and long-term exposure to pain can cause sensitisation and hypersensitivity. Oesophageal sensitivity can be evaluated ,for example, with the oesophageal multimodal probe. Treatment should target the cause of the patient's symptoms.

The mechanisms by which the mechanical events stimulate an increase in ribonucleic acid synthesis and subsequent protein synthesis are not well understood.

These lengthening muscle contractions have been shown to produce ultrastructural damage (microscopic tears in contractile proteins muscle cells) that may stimulate increased muscle protein turnover. This muscle damage produces a cascade of metabolic events that is similar to an acute phase response and includes complement activation, mobilization of neutrophils, increased circulation of skeletal muscle interleukin-1, macrophage accumulation in muscle, and an increase in muscle protein synthesis and degradation. Although endurance exercise increases the oxidation of essential amino acids and increases the requirement for dietary protein, resistance exercise results in a decrease in nitrogen excretion, lowering dietary protein needs. This increased efficiency of protein use may be important for wasting diseases such as human immunodeficiency virus infection and cancer and particularly in elderly people suffering from sarcopenia.

Scientific reports indicate that among the many elements of strength training, high volume of work and overall training load are the main factors influencing post-exercise increase in the secretion of anabolic hormones such as growth hormone (GH) or insulin (I), which stimulate muscle protein synthesis]. GH has a significant effect on the rate of protein synthesis and the type of substrates metabolized during and immediately after exercise []. This hormone also stimulates the activation and proliferation of satellite cells which facilitate myofibrillar hypertrophy []. Growth hormone has an anabolic effect on skeletal muscles, stimulates the synthesis of proteins, and facilitates the transport of amino acids into skeletal muscles, thus affecting hypertrophy of both type I and type II muscle fibres]. Insulin is one of the most potent anabolic hormones []. It exerts an anabolic effect by the increase in the collection of amino acids in muscle cells, and stimulation of protein synthesis, indirectly inhibiting catabolic reactions occurring in the body. In addition to resistance training, other factors, such as diet and supplementation also have a significant impact on post-exercise concentration of selected hormones]. The energetic state of the organism and adequate supply of protein in the diet also affect the concentration of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1)]. The anabolic effect of IGF-1 is based on the stimulation of amino acid uptake by muscles, and this factor has a significant effect on the process of transcription and translation of mRNA, protein and chondromucoprotein synthesis, inhibition of proteolysis and increase in the number of cell nuclei. IGF-1 also stimulates repair processes in the body, activates glycolysis, inhibits lipolysis, stimulates the immune system, and inhibits cell apoptosis. Serum IGF-1 elevations are induced by strength training [], but some studies suggest that this occurs only when the resting concentrations are low []. Maintaining the momentum of muscle protein synthesis is related to the turnover and metabolism of protein resources in the body, which greatly affects the anabolic processes]. The recommended protein intake for athletes is 1.5-2 g/kg body mass (BM) and in specific cases even more than 3.0 g/kg BM]. Adequate intake of protein, as well as the time and type of dietary supplements used, may have a direct impact on endocrine responses to resistance training and muscle hypertrophy]. Some researchers indicate the significant role of carbohydrate-protein (CHO-PRO) supplementation and the intake of various fractions of proteins or free amino acids before and after exercise in the process of muscle hypertrophy].

It is characterized by an optimal ratio of essential amino acids (EAA) with an exceptionally high share of branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) and glutamine]. In addition, whey protein isolates are characterized by the highest biological value, but at the same time, due to the rapid release kinetics, their activity is brief when compared to all the proteins supplied with food]. In contrast to whey protein, supplements containing a predominance of casein protein, due to their slower rate of digestion and release kinetics allow for prolonged supply of amino acids for skeletal muscles].

Important supplements used immediately after and during the first 2 hours of recovery include carbohydrate-protein products that also affect the concentration of GH and I [].

A provocative review", "text": "In the competitive sport world, several disciplines involve high level of muscle hypertrophy, as for example weight lifting and throwing sports (shot put, discus throw and hammer throw) among the field and track events. Actually, all these sports require a specific training, aimed at increasing muscle performance in terms of force and explosive power and based on resistance exercise, i.e., repeated muscle contractions against a resistance or a weight, and this type of training produces a significant muscle hypertrophy. At first sight, similar training protocols are adopted in a parallel and independent world, which is represented by bodybuilding. Athletes who train for bodybuilding develop highly hypertrophic muscles with specialized protocols of resistance training. If we compare by eye a body builder and a weight lifter we can detect differences and similarities in their body structure. Both have large muscle mass in limbs and trunk, which in athletes trained for throwing sports and power lifting are often covered by subcutaneous fat, while in body builders the combination of bulking and cutting phases remove all unnecessary fat to make muscles well visible.1 Some degree of asymmetry between left and right limbs is often detectable in trained athletes of throwing sports but never in body builders. If we then determine the contractile performance, for example by measuring the maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), we will likely discover that trained athletes perform better than body builders.2 Thus, if we ask a coach about the training protocols, which are followed by a body builder and a power lifter, the answer will be that they are very different. In both cases, the athletes will perform repeated sets of contractions against resistance, mostly given by weights or elastic bands, but the distribution of volume (number of sessions per week, or sets in each session or repetitions in each set), intensity (load or resistance), timing (intervals between sets or between exercise sessions) will be adapted to the final goal and the same holds for the nutritional support. This implies that different pathways of training have to be followed if the goal is to maximize hypertrophy or to maximize performance.3 The same question, i.e., the relation between increasing muscle mass and improving muscle performance, has been asked in the world of muscle biology and physiology for many years. The pioneering work of Rasch, published in 1955,4 asked openly whether a \"relationship exists between hypertrophy and increase in strength\" starting from the critical statement that \"it seems unlikely that any simple, direct correlation exists\". A key advancement on this issue was the identification of two phases in the resistance training, a first phase where the increase in strength was neural in origin and a second phase where muscle hypertrophy becomes the dominant factor in strength gain (Moritani and De Vries 1979). More recently, however, the relation between hypertrophy and increased contractile strength has been critically revisited by several authors. A debated issue is whether the hypertrophy is required to increase performance, and an even more general question is whether the increase in muscle mass is always associated with an increased contractile performance. This latter question is summarized in the cartoon in Figure 1, where three alternative responses to resistance training or to hormone administration are depicted: i) strength increases in proportion to muscle size (A), ii) strength increases more than size (B) and iii) strength does not increase or increases less than muscle size (C). The present short review aims to discuss under this perspective some of the available data from experimental works done in humans and in animal models.", "pmid": "33117512", "journal_title": "N/A", "PubDate_year": null, "PubDate_month": null, "PubDate_date": null}, {"rank": 10, "score": 100.65637, "title": "Chronic Intake of a Meal Including Alaska Pollack Protein Increases Skeletal Muscle Mass and Strength in Healthy Older Women: A Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial", "text": "In this study, smaller increases in SMI (mean ± SD Δ SMI: +1.38% ± 3.41%) and knee extensor strength (Mean ± SD Δ knee extension strength: +2.69% ± 8.93%) after 12 wk of APP meal intake were observed than those in a previous study, in which APP meal and resistance exercise intervention were combined (Mean ± SD Δ skeletal muscle mass: +2.0% ± 3.2%; Mean ± SD Δ knee extension strength: +17.1% ± 4.4%).

And an option can become more valuable, if it has been around for a while. Accordingly, withdrawing options can sometimes reduce freedom more than withholding an equivalent option. For example, options can become valuable, if they become part of people's community and identity, if that option has entered people's plans, and if removing the option would come with transition costs for individuals.24 However, while these reasons apply to cigarettes, they only apply weakly.

Although most of them did not choose the internet first, more internet users thought that the online health information was useful. And the finding was more commonly seen in younger adults, individuals with higher educational level, people from the service-based tertiary industry and people with excellent health. The results were similar to those from another study in Japan.They also observed that the prevalence of internet use for acquiring health-related information was low. And the internet was used for acquiring health-related information primarily by younger people and people with higher educational levels. This was because older people and those with a lower educational level were unfamiliar with the internet and had barriers to access health-related information. Hence, the effective solution was to train them to be familiar with the internet and make internet access easier. In China, with the rapid ageing of the Chinese population, the number of residents who are familiar with the internet and free of barriers to internet access would increase. However, the reality that most rural residents trust doctors would not change rapidly. And they believe more in doctors in big-city top-flight hospitals. As the numbers of doctors in big-city top-flight hospitals are relatively limited, they often queue overnight just to get a consultation lasting a few minutes,and they often have difficulty gaining access to appropriate healthcare.Hence, the internet hospital emerged in China. Internet hospital refers to a new approach to provide health services by qualified doctors in top hospitals through internet technology.As internet hospital overcomes geographical obstacles and shatters time barriers, it could meet their needs with the doctor and internet simultaneously. In China, the population of internet medical services users was 194.8 million in 2016, accounting for 26.6% of all internet users.Therefore, it could address the difficulty of waiting times by providing Chinese patients online access to skilled doctors.Up to now, the internet hospital is still a medical development model, whose function is similar with traditional ones, including medical information, electronic health records, disease risk assessment, disease/health counselling, electronic prescription, telemedicine and health education.Its final model should be a smart hospital, which entails providing big data, artificial intelligence and precision medicine.

Two scenarios could explain this pattern: 1) Co-option of LTR retrotransposon genes does occur at an extremely low frequency; and 2) co-option of LTR retrotransposon genes occurs frequently, but co-opted genes are frequently lost. In our previous study of retrovirus gene co-option, we also observed a similar pattern: retrovirus gene co-option is relatively rare in the deep branches of vertebrates, which is likely due to frequent co-option and frequent loss. We think the paucity of LTR retrotransposon gag gene co-option during the deep evolution of eukaryotes could be explained by frequent co-option and frequent loss, and mining co-option events within the level of taxonomic family would help confirm this hypothesis. Our analyses came with several caveats: 1) We only mined annotated proteomes of eukaryotes, and many retrotransposon-related genes might not be well annotated. Thus, the number of co-opted LTR retrotransposon gag genes are underestimated in this study. 2) We only sampled ∼740 eukaryote families. It is possible that many co-option events occurred recently, and these relatively recent co-option events might not be unearthed in this study. 3) Our data set is biased to animals, fungi, and plants, as most genome sequencing has been performed in these groups, which might result in underestimation of LTR co-option in protists. However, our study well covers the deep diversity of eukaryotes, and covers the major diversity of animals, plants, and fungi. If a co-option event occurred in deep past and the co-opted gene pass on to its descendants, and if the co-opted gene has been annotated in some of the descendants, our analysis could capture this event. It follows that we might not miss many co-option events occurred in deep past (especially within animals, plants, and fungi), such as the emergence of tetrapods or the emergence of angiosperms.

The net effect of such an adaptation could potentially be a sparing of muscle glycogen, and because muscle glycogen storage is coupled to endurance performance, it is possible that adaptation to a high-fat diet potentially could enhance endurance performance. Therefore, the first issue in this review is to critically evaluate the available evidence for a potential endurance performance enhancement after long-term fat-rich diet adaptation. Attainment of optimal performance is among other factors dependent also on the quality and quantity of the training performed. When exercise intensity is increased, there is an increased need for carbohydrates. On the other hand, consumption of a fat-rich diet decreases the storage of glycogen in both muscle and liver. Therefore, training intensity may be compromised in individuals while consuming a fat-rich diet. During submaximal exercise, fat for oxidation in muscle is recruited from plasma fatty acids, plasma triacylglycerol, and muscle triacylglycerol: the final question addressed in this review is which of these source(s) of fat contributes to the increased oxidation of fat during submaximal exercise after long-term fat diet adaptation.", "pmid": "", "journal_title": "Cell biology and toxicology", "PubDate_year": null, "PubDate_month": null, "PubDate_date": null}, {"rank": 6, "score": 96.00373, "title": "Role of nutrition in performance enhancement and postexercise recovery", "text": "Carbohydrate loading aims to maximize an athlete’s muscle glycogen stores prior to endurance exercise lasting longer than 90 minutes.

For example, Sherman et al. found that participants who were fed moderate- or high-carbohydrate diets (5 vs 10 g/kg BW/d) over 7 days of training were able to maintain their glycogen stores from day to day on the high-carbohydrate diet but experienced a 30%–36% decline in muscle glycogen on the moderate-carbohydrate diet. However, the lower muscle glycogen levels did not impair training capacity or exercise performance (run or cycle to exhaustion at 80% VO2 peak.) In their review of the literature, Sherman and Wimer came to the conclusion that high-carbohydrate diets can prevent a fall in muscle glycogen stores over weeks of intense training; in contrast, moderate-carbohydrate diets maintain muscle glycogen stores at levels that are lower but still sufficient to meet the demands of hard training. In an exhaustive review of the literature on dietary carbohydrate intake among athletes, Burke et al. hypothesized that athletes can adapt to lower muscle glycogen stores in ways that protect training capacity and performance. Although training capacity and performance may not be adversely affected by the consumption of moderate-carbohydrate diets, performance is impaired on low-carbohydrate diets. Burke et al. reported that race walkers who trained for 3 weeks on a low-carbohydrate diet (2.1 g/kg BW/d) did not improve their 10-km race walk performance compared with those who consumed a high-carbohydrate diet (8.6 g/kg BW/d). The high-carbohydrate group improved their performance by 6.6%, whereas performance in the low-carbohydrate group did not change (−1.6%) from baseline measures. In practical terms, athletes should be educated and encouraged to consume enough carbohydrates to replenish at least a sizable portion of their muscle glycogen stores so that training intensity can be maintained from day to day. Fortunately, athletes in training tend to gravitate to high-carbohydrate diets, helping ensure that glycogen stores do not drop so low that training is impaired.

Such training is essential because only a small proportion of patients receive information on inhaler use, with an even smaller proportion of patients having their inhaler technique checked over time. Pharmacists can also educate patients on how the medication present in their inhalers alleviates the symptoms of asthma and improves lung function. However, it is important that pharmacists do not rely on written or verbal instructions alone but also employ a step-by-step demonstration of inhalation technique with periodic reassessments. Following demonstration, pharmacists can assess patients’ technique and rectify as necessary. Repeating this training during follow-up visits will help consolidate the correct inhaler technique over time and eliminate errors.

One is the CIRCLE option that can be used in those who have a VisuMax platform. In SMILE re-treatment, this method has been shown to be safe and effective]. Importantly, there is substantial evidence to support the observations that the flap is easily lifted and the flap-bed surface is smooth and undisrupted]. This method can be adopted quickly by surgeons familiar with SMILE and the CIRCLE enhancement software. Additionally, the smaller pocket size in the CIRCLE option may allow for better centration. However, VisuMax is unable to create flap diameters as large as the other two femtosecond lasers. The resulting reduced treatment area may make it a less ideal approach for residual hyperopic enhancement. With this method, it’s important to ensure the patient will be overcorrected rather than undercorrected. This may include reducing the cap depth to 110 µm. For surgeons without the VisuMax platform, a side cut only method can be used via iFS or FS200. Using these femtosecond lasers, a much larger pocket and flap size can be generated. Thus, this enhancement option is more effective for hyperopia treatment (undercorrected patients) since it has the capability to ablate more peripheral tissue. However, this may make centration more difficult. A comprehensive list of advantages and disadvantages of both recommended enhancement techniques is provided in Table 3. We do not feel comfortable recommending a thin-flap LASIK given the elevated risk for bubble gas breakthrough or buttonhole that could result in an irregular astigmatism that may not be amenable to treatment. If the cap depth is increased, this option may be another safe alternative. Surface ablation is also another alternative, however due to the accompanying pain, postoperative haze, and slower visual recovery, this may not be an attractive option for patients.
