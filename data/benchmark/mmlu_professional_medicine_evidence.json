The new anti-chemokine oral drug XC8 could represent an alternative treatment option for these patients. The objective of this trial was to evaluate the effect of different doses of the XC8 in patients with partly controlled asthma in a phase 2a clinical trial. A double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, multicenter, phase 2a trial was conducted at 12 sites in Russia. Patients with asthma were randomized into four groups (n = 30 each) to receive XC8 at 2 mg, 10 mg, 100 mg or placebo once-daily for 12 weeks in addition to low-dose ICS with or without LABA. Efficacy and safety parameters were evaluated at weeks 0, 2, 6, and 12. No statistically significant difference between the treatment arms in the number of patients with adverse events was observed. The primary endpoint, improvement of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) % predicted over 12 weeks compared to placebo, was not statistically significant.

Patients with elevated peripheral blood eosinophil count (PBEC, > 300 cells/μl) or serum interferon-γ (IFN-γ) level (> 100 pg/mL) treated with XC8 (100 mg) achieved a statistically significant improvement in FEV1 (11.33% predicted or 8.69% predicted, respectively, p < 0.05) as compared to the baseline versus the placebo. The strongest effect was observed in patients with both high PBEC and IFN-γ level. Pharmacodynamic engagement was demonstrated through the reduction of serum levels of C–C motif ligand 2 (CCL2) and C–X–C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10). Treatment with XC8 (100 mg) alleviated resistance to maintenance ICS therapy in patients with elevated IFN-γ level.

Closely correlated with the increase in muscle fatty acid oxidation is the phosphorylation/inactivation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which leads to reduced malonyl-CoA concentration. Lowering muscle malonyl-CoA, a potent inhibitor of carnitine/palmitoyl-CoA transferase 1 (CPT1), releases CPT1 from inhibitory constraint, facilitating the entry of fatty acids into mitochondria for beta oxidation.

During and following myocardial ischemia a number of alterations in fatty acid oxidation occur that result in an excessive amount of fatty acids being used as a fuel source by the heart. This contributes to a decrease in cardiac efficiency both during and following the ischemic episode. Central to the regulation of fatty acid oxidation in the heart is malonyl CoA, which is a potent endogenous inhibitor of mitochondrial fatty acid uptake. The levels of malonyl CoA are regulated both by its synthesis by acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) and its degradation by malonyl CoA decarboxylase (MCD). ACC is in turn controlled by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which acts as a fuel gauge in the heart. The control of these enzymes are altered during ischemia, such that malonyl CoA levels in the heart decrease, resulting in an increased relative contribution of fatty acids to oxidative metabolism. Activation of AMPK during and following ischemia appears to be centrally involved in this decrease in malonyl CoA. Clinical evidence is now accumulating that show that inhibition of fatty acid oxidation is an effective approach to treating ischemic heart disease. As a result, modulation of fatty acid oxidation by targeting the enzymes controlling malonyl CoA may be a novel approach to treating angina pectoris and acute myocardial infarction.

The regulation of muscle CPT1 by malonyl-CoA cannot fully explain changes in mitochondrial fatty acid import. Thus, malonyl-CoA is not responsible for the increase in fatty acid oxidation during the transition from low to moderate aerobic exercise or for the decrease in fatty acid oxidation during more strenuous exercise. Moreover, concentrations of malonyl-CoA measured in muscle (1–4 µM) should inhibit CPT1 activity at any time, since the IC50 of CPT1B for malonyl-CoA is much lower than this concentration (∼0.03 µM). Several hypotheses have been advanced to explain this discordance between malonyl-CoA levels, CPT1 regulation, and LCFA oxidation in muscle. Thus, alteration in compartmentalization/cellular distribution of malonyl-CoA may be involved in the control of CPT1 activity. It has been proposed that the malonyl-CoA involved in CPT1 regulation is that synthesized by acetyl-CoA carboxylase 2, which resides in the vicinity of CPT1 in the outer mitochondrial membrane and modulates CPT1 activity.

However, whether this pathway is vital for regulating skeletal muscle fatty acid oxidation during conditions of increased metabolic flux such as exercise/muscle contractions remains unknown. To examine this we characterized mice lacking AMPK phosphorylation sites on ACC2 (S212 in mice/S221 in humans-ACC2-knock-in [ACC2-KI]) or both ACC1 (S79) and ACC2 (S212) (ACC double knock-in [ACCD-KI]) during submaximal treadmill exercise and/or ex vivo muscle contractions.

Similar effects were obtained with high concentrations of fatty acid in the absence of glucagon and, under these conditions, the additional presence of the hormone produced little further response. The results are consistent with the concept that the rate of fatty acid oxidation in liver is dictated largely by the relative concentrations of long-chain acyl-CoA (substrate for carnitine acyltransferase I) and malonyl-CoA (inhibitor of the transferase).

On physical examination, she demonstrated hyperreflexia, ocular clonus, spontaneous muscular clonus, and facial tremors. These symptoms and physical examination findings led to concern for serotonin syndrome, and as a result, methylene blue was discontinued. Her ondansetron was stopped for the same reason. She received IV lorazepam, metoprolol, acetaminophen, and hydromorphone for symptomatic management.

Instead of BARI, iguratimod (IGU) 25 mg/day was prescribed, but she stopped taking IGU in a few days later due to itching symptoms on her entire body. Finally, she had been treated with PSL only, without any new medication after she stopped taking BARI. After 3 months of only PSL intake, she visited our hospital due to generalized pain and difficulty in performing physical movement. There were no falls or trauma, but she could not walk.

Treatment depends on the condition of the glenohumeral joint and the patient's age, activity level, and symptoms. Although reverse shoulder arthroplasty is a valuable treatment option in the presence of combined irreparable rotator cuff (RC) tear and osteoarthritis, it should be avoided in young patients with intact cartilage in the glenohumeral joint. Various reconstruction techniques for the treatment of irreparable SSC tears have been described, including transfer of the pectoralis minor tendon, upper trapezius transfer, and pectoralis major (PM) transfer, of which the latter is the most frequently performed procedure.

Venous dimensions are not influenced by knee flexion in other reports, perhaps because of lack of ambulation. However, in the current study, use of the MKS elicited a larger venous diameter than baseline and AC but lower venous flow than walking, supporting previous evidence that weightbearing with a straight knee stimulates venous flow more than weightbearing on a flexed knee. This combination of dilation without comparable flow increase is likely indicative of venous pooling. However, despite having a flexed knee, venous flow following HFC was not different than walking. The effect of knee flexion in HFC was likely mitigated by its unique ambulation similar to walking gait, given that muscular activity is a major determinant of popliteal venous flow, and previously mentioned evidence demonstrates elevated surface electromyography when using HFC.

These symptoms were present for the last 15 years but for the last 1 year those are increasing in intensity. Alongside these symptoms, he also reported as having decreased sleep and appetite and increased fatigability for the last 4 months. The patient reported that he had a difficult childhood because of his alcoholic father, who would often beat up his mother and him. On attaining puberty, like any adolescent he started having sexual thoughts about the opposite gender; however, soon he realized that these thoughts were coming even when he looked at any idol of Hindu female Goddesses. Distressed by the severely blasphemous nature of these thoughts he tried to control it by diverting his attention elsewhere, but, soon he realized that those thoughts were repetitive and intrusive and it was only following masturbation he could attain a temporary relief. Convinced that he is a grave sinner beyond penance, he stopped attending any religious ceremony and would cover his eyes when he would pass in front of a temple. At the age of 15, while in class XI, he got ragged including physical abuse by his school seniors. He considered this incidence, as an act of God for his sins. However, soon after this, he developed a new symptom. Whenever he used to hear a new song/tune/poetry, it would repeatedly play in his head for long duration despite his efforts to stop them. He described the feeling as, “as if I have a radio without control in my mind.” This repetition of tune/song would continue until he hears a new one. These songs were quite clear and varied from religious to sensual/sexual in content. He reported that these songs/tunes were coming from inside his head and it never from outside. He was forced to sing these songs alone to himself for long hours. In the year 2008, a consultation was sought at this tertiary care hospital, where after detailed investigations and physical and mental state evaluation a provisional diagnosis of OCD was made. Routine blood and urine investigation, electroencephalogram, and computed tomographic scan were done which came out to be normal. He was started on pharmacotherapy along with behavior psychotherapy. The patient took treatment for many years in which a variety of molecules (escitalopram, desvenlafaxine, clomipramine, fluvoxamine, and risperidone) were used in adequate dose along with psychotherapy in form of thought blocking. The patient responded well to treatment, and there was decrease in intensity and frequency of his symptoms. He also developed good insight and understanding toward his illness. He left medication about 1 year back thinking that he was cured, following which there was gradual relapse of the symptoms. When he came to us again, he had marked social and occupational dysfunction. We evaluated the patient in detail and did necessary investigations. Mental state examination showed a properly groomed, ectomorphic built individual with reduced psychomotor activity with coherent and relevant speech. Patient's mood was depressed with the appropriate affect of constricted range. He did not have any formal thought disorder but thought content included intense guilt feeling, death wish, predominantly obsessive musical thoughts along with blasphemous thoughts about Hindu Goddesses and compulsive masturbation. He did not have any perceptual abnormalities. The patient however, had grade IV insight about his problem. Hamilton's Anxiety and Depression Rating Scale (HAM-A and HAM-D)[] was applied which showed moderate level of anxiety (HAM-A score 23) and depression (HAM-D score 20). Patient scored 26 on Y-BOCS.[] Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the patient was done which came out to be normal. After application of MINI International Neuropsychiatric Interview[] a diagnosis of OCD with the depressive disorder was formulated.

He was made to understand the nature and course of his illness and also relaxation techniques were taught to control anxiety whenever required. After 4 weeks of treatment, the patient started responding to the treatment with escitalopram (40 mg/day) and behavior therapy.

His mother, in her 60s, was also diagnosed with COVID-19, and during the hospitalisation, her physical condition deteriorated rapidly, requiring mechanical ventilation. While the patient was hospitalised, his mother passed away due to the illness, and her last rites were conducted by his other family members. The patient came to know of his mother’s demise only after his discharge and was shocked on hearing the news. He expressed guilt for not being able to give his mother company in the last few days of her life and not participating in her funeral rites. His family members tried to console him, but he was not reassured. He would remain tearful throughout the day and preferred to stay isolated. His sleep, appetite and self-care were normal during this period. After 2 weeks, patient’s sleep gradually reduced to 1.5–2 hours/day. Despite not sleeping, the patient would appear active throughout the day. He also became more talkative and would constantly talk about his mother. He would also appear authoritative to his family members and order them to follow his instructions. He would be constantly engaged in household chores, even when they had already been done by his wife. His predominant mood was irritable, and he would have anger outbursts. He would try to go out of the house despite the lockdown, saying that he was going to the Prime Minister’s office to instruct him on how to control the pandemic. If family members stopped him, he would try to run out of the house and become verbally aggressive.

Further, since blastocyst culture is increasingly becoming the norm, and with it the freezing of blastocysts, the worry that freezing embryos may give ‘false hope’ to a couple will be reduced. Overall, as we have indicated, our recommendation is aimed at protecting reproductive interests by maximising treatment options. So, for example, if a woman does not give birth to a child as a result of her first cycle of IVF, she can then elect either to have a frozen replacement cycle, provided that embryos from the previous cycle have been frozen where possible, or to undergo the risks of another fresh cycle. Alternatively, if she does give birth to a child but later wishes to have another child, a minimum period of about fifteen months will ensue between her first and second cycles of IVF. During this time, her fertility will have declined—particularly if she is not young, as is often the case with IVF—so that she may respond less well to the stimulation drugs in a second fresh cycle.

However, the patient was serum JC virus antibody positive, and the patient and her neurologist decided against switching to natalizumab because of the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. The patient and her neurologist also discussed switching to the oral DMT, fingolimod, when it became available, but the patient decided against switching because of concerns about cardiac side effects and uncertainty about the long-term risks of the drug. In 2013, the patient and her neurologist decided to switch her to dimethyl fumarate to gain better control of her disease and avoid the problems associated with an injectable DMT. However, her insurance company denied coverage of dimethyl fumarate, indicating that “the member does not meet the following criteria: No documented contraindication or intolerance or allergy or failure of a 1 month trial of Copaxone [glatiramer acetate].” The neurologist subsequently had a peer-to-peer review with the company's medical director. He would not approve dimethyl fumarate without a trial of glatiramer acetate despite the results of a pivotal trial suggesting superiority of dimethyl fumarate over glatiramer acetate and the patient's inability to perform self-injections. The neurologist wrote a letter appealing the denial but never received a response. The patient believed she could not do daily injections of glatiramer acetate. After further delays in therapy that were stressful for the patient, she qualified for a Biogen-sponsored program through which she obtained dimethyl fumarate at no cost.

This is achieved through an intricate balance between glucose uptake and endogenous glucose production to maintain constant glucose concentration.

After a carbohydrate meal, ~33% of the glucose is taken up by the liver, another ~33% by muscles and adipose tissues, and the remainder by the brain, kidney and red blood cells.

An increase in blood glucose concentration after meal results in increased insulin secretion which in turn stimulates the liver to store glucose as glycogen (Figure 1). Once the liver and muscle cells become saturated with glycogen, additional glucose is stored as fat. On the contrary, a decrease in blood glucose concentration stimulates glucagon secretion which activates glycogenolysis in the liver to release glucose back into the bloodstream. Amid starvation, the liver tries to keep up a normal glucose concentration by means of the process of gluconeogenesis, which involves framing glucose from amino acids and the glycerol. Muscle cells provide glycogen and protein to be separated into amino acids, which are then used as substrates for gluconeogenesis in the liver. Few vital organs including brain catabolize unsaturated fats to ketones, acetoacetate, and β-hydroxybutyrate and use them as fuel asset. The hypothalamus stimulates the sympathetic nervous system, causing secretion of epinephrine by the adrenal glands. This permits additional release of glucose from the liver.

As part of this research, we currently are investigating the metabolic effects of ingested individual amino acids. The objective of the current study was to determine whether leucine stimulates insulin and/or glucagon secretion and whether, when it is ingested with glucose, it modifies the glucose, insulin, or glucagon response. Thirteen healthy subjects (6 men and 7 women) were studied on 4 different occasions. Subjects were admitted to the special diagnostic and treatment unit after a 12-hour fast. They received test meals at 8:00 am. On the first occasion, they received water only. Thereafter, they received 25 g glucose or 1 mmol/kg lean body mass leucine or 1 mmol/kg lean body mass leucine plus 25 g glucose in random order. Serum leucine, glucose, insulin, glucagon, and alpha-amino nitrogen concentrations were measured at various times during a 2.5-hour period after ingestion of the test meal. The amount of leucine provided was equivalent to that present in a high-protein meal, that is, that approximately present in a 350-g steak. After leucine ingestion, the leucine concentration increased 7-fold; and the alpha-amino nitrogen concentration increased by 16%. Ingested leucine did not affect the serum glucose concentration. When leucine was ingested with glucose, it reduced the 2.5-hour glucose area response by 50%. Leucine, when ingested alone, increased the serum insulin area response modestly. However, it increased the insulin area response to glucose by an additional 66%; that is, it almost doubled the response. Ingested leucine stimulated an increase in glucagon. Ingested glucose decreased it. When ingested together, the net effect was essentially no change in glucagon area. In summary, leucine at a dose equivalent to that present in a high-protein meal, had little effect on serum glucose or insulin concentrations but did increase the glucagon concentration. When leucine was ingested with glucose, it attenuated the serum glucose response and strongly stimulated additional insulin secretion. Leucine also attenuated the decrease in glucagon expected when glucose alone is ingested. The data suggest that a rise in glucose concentration is necessary for leucine to stimulate significant insulin secretion.

During the 5-h period after each meal, we measured the recovery of [(13)C]glucose in plasma, plasma glucose, and insulin concentrations.

In parallel with these findings, the reduction in fat calories from the meal reduced plasma concentration of GIP, GLP-1, and PYY(3-36).

Serum glucose concentrations 60 min after BF and LN meals were lower when 43 g of almonds were ingested with the meals. This may be attributable to the fiber and fat content of almonds. Fiber reduces glycemia by: (a) increasing the viscosity of intestinal contents hindering glucose diffusion; (b) lowering the glucose concentration by reducing carbohydrate availability in the gastrointestinal tract; and (c) capsulation of starch and hence impairing α-amylase activity. Fat derived from the almonds may have also caused lower postprandial glycemia by slowing gastric emptying times and dilution. The glycemia-lowering-effect of fats is primarily due to a decreased absorption rate rather than an increased clearance from the circulation. This is in agreement with our finding, where muted glucose responses were not due to higher postprandial insulin concentrations. However, serum glucose concentrations decreased when almonds were consumed alone as snacks (Figure 2) suggesting an enhancement of clearance. Future studies are required to better understand the underlying mechanisms that elevate glucose clearance from the circulation after almond snacks. Because of a reduction in glucose concentrations in the MS group, glycemic responses remained low following standard LN.

To address this gap and improve the practice of SDM in pediatrics, a practical 4-step framework is presented. In step 1, physicians are posed the following question for any discrete decision: does the decision include >1 medically reasonable option? If the answer is no, SDM is not indicated. If the answer is yes, physicians proceed to step 2 and answer the following question: does 1 option have a favorable medical benefit-burden ratio compared with other options? If yes, physician-guided SDM is appropriate. If no, parent-guided SDM is appropriate. For each SDM approach, the physician proceeds to step 3 and answers the following question: how preference sensitive are the options? This helps to determine the specific SDM approach in step 4, which ranges from a strong or weak version of physician-guided SDM to a strong or weak version of parent-guided SDM.

The reported incidence of inguinal hernia at this age varies from 0.8% to 4.4%, which is more likely to occur in boys. Also, bilateral inguinal hernias are relatively common in children.[ Herniorrhaphy (high ligation of the hernia sac for children) has always been the choice and standard treatment for inguinal hernia and is estimated to be used in more than 20 million cases per year worldwide.[ With the development in surgical technology, a number of medical centers adopted laparoscopic hernia repair in children as the best option for herniorrhaphy, replacing the open procedure due to minimal invasiveness and better cosmetic effect. Over the past 2 decades, laparoscopic procedures for pediatric inguinal hernia repair have gained increased popularity. It is commonly believed that laparoscopic surgery is a minimally invasive treatment option and more advantageous for bilateral inguinal hernia repair in children. Undeniably, laparoscopic surgery has obvious advantages over open surgery because of its minimally invasive, cosmetic effects, safety, and less complications, although a variety of surgical methods are available for the treatment of bilateral inguinal hernia in children. Nevertheless, the application of laparoscopy in treating inguinal hernias in children remains controversial. The reported high recurrence rate and long learning curve in literatures are among its disadvantages.[ As a result, some surgeons are also in favor of open surgery. A 24-year study by Pogorelić et al[ from Japan found that Marcy hernia repair is a safe and effective procedure for inguinal hernia in children with excellent outcomes and a low incidence of recurrence. Indeed, open repair procedure, as a gold standard for hernia repair, remains the mainstay of treating pediatric bilateral inguinal hernia at present. Although there is variability in the way surgeons perform some of the technical aspects of inguinal herniotomy, we know of no technique that describes a small single transverse suprapubic incision to repair bilateral inguinal hernia in children. Hence, we introduced a new surgical method with minimally invasive effect for the treatment of bilateral inguinal hernia in children. In fact, Uceda[ first described a single transverse suprapubic incision for bilateral inguinal hernia repair in 1994, which was considered simple and practical for bilateral inguinal hernia repair in girls. According to his point of view, this single incision method was not recommended for the repair of bilateral inguinal hernia in boys due to concerns about difficult surgical procedures and inevitable complications. However, in the following decades, few studies have reported the use of a single incision method to repair bilateral inguinal hernia in the literature, and so far there have been rare reports on the use of this technique in boys. With the advancement in laparoscopic surgery, it remains unclear to date if there is any change in the prevalence, including conventional surgery, of bilateral inguinal hernia repairs in children. Currently, there is still the basic question of whether the new procedure can be applied to boys or the fact that it results in spermatic cord injury or surgical failure. To this end, we introduced this approach named single-incision bilateral inguinal herniorrhaphy (SBIH) in pediatric surgical population at our institution as a less invasive and more cosmetically appealing technique.", "pmid": "32118783", "journal_title": "N/A", "PubDate_year": null, "PubDate_month": null, "PubDate_date": null}, {"rank": 5, "score": 151.50014, "title": "Amyand’s hernia with acute gangrenous appendicitis and cecal perforation: A case report and review of the literature", "text": "A 46-year-old male patient presented to the Emergency Department with 24 h of abdominal pain and vomiting with worsening lower abdominal, right groin, and testicular pain and swelling.

Our previous study showed two patients (8%) with asymptomatic varicocele that became painful varicocele after herniorrhaphy during follow-up, and both of the patients had an indirect inguinal hernia and a smaller body mass index. A possible explanation may be adhesion after dissection, obstructing venous return in the spermatic cord, and a lower body mass index may have disadvantages in relieving the nutcracker phenomenon.In the current study, we found a smaller risk of developing ipsilateral varicocele after herniorrhaphy, but clinicians should pay attention to patients in the age group of 10–19 years. Some issues might have an impact on the age factor. First, use of a different surgical technique for herniorrhaphy was noted between younger and older patients, and many younger patients received high ligation only without posterior wall repair. Second, pubertal boys and some adolescents still had testicular growth after herniorrhaphy. Third, younger subjects were more likely to undertake strenuous physical activity compared with older subjects.

However, the association between herniorrhaphy and development of post-herniorrhaphy varicocele is still unclear, and compared with the high prevalence of varicocele in the general population, the chance of post-herniorrhaphy varicocele is trivial and clinical insignificant.

With a standardised diagnosis consisting of a clinical examination, conventional X-ray and MRI, the causes of the functional problems can often be reliably determined. Therapy of abductor deficiency is challenging for both patients and physicians and is often tedious.

Conservative therapy with eccentric stretching and muscle strengthening are the basis of the treatment. In cases of progression of complaints despite intensive conservative treatment, various anatomical and extra-anatomical surgical reconstruction methods are available to relieve pain and improve function. Anatomical reconstruction of the gluteal tendon insertion is an option in cases of low-grade fatty infiltration and moderate retraction of the gluteal muscles.

Studies in acute pharyngitis demonstrated that single- and multiple-dose flurbiprofen 8.75 mg, locally administered in lozenge, spray or microgranule form, was well tolerated and provided early onset and long-lasting symptomatic relief from throat pain and soreness, sensation of swollen throat, difficulty swallowing, and other associated symptoms.

Positive DRE (subjective examination, depends on physicians skills) and increased PSA value (objective, numerical findings) indicate that there is a greater chance of cancer diagnosis. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is a 33 kDa protein consisting of a single-chain glycoprotein of 237 amino acid residues, 4 carbohydrate side chains and multiple disulfide bonds first identified in seminal plasma in 1971 by Hara et al. and subsequently isolated from prostatic tissue in 1979 by Wang et al.. It belongs to the group of serine proteases with extensive structural similarity to the glandular kallikrein, with which it shares considerable structural and functional homology and a gene location on the long arm of chromosome 19 (19q13.2±q13.4). It is produced by prostate secretory epithelium and vesiculae seminales and is one of the most abundant proteins in seminal plasma where it is found in concentrations of 0.2–5.0 mg/mL. PSA is predominantly found in serum in 3 different molecular forms: free PSA (molecular mass 30 kDa), bound to alpha-2-macroglobulin (molecular mass 780kDa) and bound to alpha-anti-chymotrypsin (molecular mass 90kDa). In the serum of healthy men in physiological conditions there is a very low concentration of PSA of prostate origin. PSA in serum is present only in case of disrupted microarchitecture of prostate gland tissue, which becomes the cause of PSA crossing into the surrounding extracellular space, where is being swept away by lymph in the systemic circulation and is always an indication of trauma or prostate disease. In serum, normal range is from 0.1 to 4 ng/mL. PSA test allows doctors to detect prostate cancer, while they are still small, low grade and localized. PSA is a prostate-specific, but not specific to prostate cancer, and is also increased in other diseases of the prostate (prostatitis, benign prostatic hyperplasia), and in diagnostic procedures, as well as some of the physiological processes. PSA is increased to about 0.3 ng/mL per gram in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) while this level per gram in cancer rises 10 times, or 3 ng/mL. The increased value of PSA is found in 20% to 50% of men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Approximately 10% of the male population has a PSA value higher than 10 ng/mL, but don’t have cancer. When talked about non-specificity there is a fact that PSA is found in many tissues, especially those that are hormone active. PSA is located in male and female periurethral and perianal glands, and is elevated in cystitis, healthy endometrium and in many carcinomas (urethra, bladder, penis, parotid, kidney, adrenal, colon, ovarian, lung, hepatic, and breast). Elevation of PSA levels has been proven in acute prostatitis, subclinical or chronic prostatitis and urinary retention. There are no significant changes in the value of PSA after DRE, but powerful massage of the prostate can lead to short-term increase. A biopsy of the prostate increases PSA, and it takes from 2 to 4 weeks to return to normal PSA value. Prostate volume also affects the value of PSA. For larger prostate (>40 cm3) PSAT is superior to Free to Total PSA Ratio (PSAR) in the detection of prostate cancer, while in smaller prostate PSAR is more important. The most important role of PSA is monitoring of prostate cancer treatment. The concentration of PSA is essential information that helps evaluate the effectiveness of the therapy as well as to determine the probability of finding residual disease (local or distant). It also draws attention to the biochemical relapse and the occurrence of metastases before it is possible to identify them with other conventional diagnostic procedures. Approximately 70% of patients with elevated PSA values do not have prostate cancer. Between 25-40% of patients have cancer at values below 10 ng/mL. This means that 40-75% of them will have to go through unnecessary and uncomfortable examination. Also 15% of patients with PSA values from 2.5 to 4 ng/mL have prostate cancer. PSA values are increased in proportion to the increase of age, and increases from 0.7 to 1.5 mL per year. On this basis normal, baseline PSA values, vary according to the age of the patient (in patients <40 years 0-2 ng/mL, 50-59 years 0-3.5 ng/mL, >80 years 0-7.2 ng/mL). Oesterling et al. found that in 60-year-old man PSA increases to about 0.04 ng/mL in one year. When PSAT is >10.0 ng/mL, the probability of cancer is high, and prostate biopsy is usually recommended. In favor of non-specificity of PSA are results according to which 20% to 30% men with prostate cancer have PSA less than 4 ng/mL. The total PSA range from 4.0 to 10.0 ng/mL is described as a diagnostic “gray zone” (doctors before other diagnostic tests have to consider digital rectal examination), in which are used many developed indexes (age-specific PSA, PSA density, acceleration of PSA, PSA density of the transition zone, PSAR, which help to determine relative risk of prostate cancer. PSA has the highest positive predictive value for cancer and is objective indicator of the risk of prostate cancer. Analysis showed that men with prostate cancer have higher PSA levels than men without cancer, years before conventional diagnosis with DRE. The chances of the biopsy proven cancer are 1 in 50 men with PSA below 4.0 ng/mL, 1 out of 3 for PSA value of 4.0 ng/mL or higher, 1 out of 4 for value for PSA values from 4 to 10, and 1 out of 2, or 2 out of 3 for PSA value higher than 10 ng/mL. If the serum PSA value is between 4 and 10 ng/mL, positive predictive value for cancer is about 30%. If the PSA value is > 10 ng/mL the positive predictive value is higher than 60%.

A blood sample to enable tPSA, free PSA, and p2PSA levels to be calculated was drawn before the prostate biopsy. The diagnosis and detection of high-grade cancer are correlated with the blood sample. Sixteen patients were positive for prostate cancer. All had significantly higher serum 2pPSA and PHI levels than patients with no cancer. A PHI level at 90% sensitivity (cutoff of 34.14) demonstrated a higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and more specificity in diagnosis and detection of high-grade prostate cancer than other tests. The PHI in men with a PSA level of 4–10 ng/mL with negative DRE increased specificity in the detection of prostate cancer. This test is useful in discriminating between patients with or without cancer and also enables the detection of high-grade cancer avoiding unnecessary biopsies.", "pmid": "30505815", "journal_title": "N/A", "PubDate_year": null, "PubDate_month": null, "PubDate_date": null}]}

We found that students with depression were more likely to report that needing to be on camera for class and the potential for their surroundings to embarrass them while on camera increased their anxiety. Literature has shown that students with depression value maintaining anonymity. One interview study of students with depression found that needing to be on camera during online course work can worsen students’ depression because they cannot hide when they are feeling sad or upset, and undergraduates are often reluctant to reveal their depression to peers and mentors; the camera being on may be particularly detrimental when students are feeling sad or disengaged, making it harder for students to conceal their depression from others. Additionally, we found that students with depression were more likely than students without depression to report that being able to access content at a later time, having the flexibility of attending class where they want, and having assignments without deadlines decreased their anxiety. This may be because students with depression report difficulty focusing and staying motivated in academic environments (;;, which would make having access to content at any time helpful.

Patients often choose surgery if medical and endoscopic interventions fail. Surgical approaches for chronic pancreatitis can be categorized as follows: resection of the diseased gland, diversion and drainage of the dilated pancreatic duct, or a combination of these approaches. Frey’s procedure, which involves resection and drainage by longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy and coring out of the pancreatic head, is reserved for patients with debilitating pain.

His mother, in her 60s, was also diagnosed with COVID-19, and during the hospitalisation, her physical condition deteriorated rapidly, requiring mechanical ventilation. While the patient was hospitalised, his mother passed away due to the illness, and her last rites were conducted by his other family members.

He expressed guilt for not being able to give his mother company in the last few days of her life and not participating in her funeral rites. His family members tried to console him, but he was not reassured. He would remain tearful throughout the day and preferred to stay isolated. His sleep, appetite and self-care were normal during this period. After 2 weeks, patient’s sleep gradually reduced to 1.5–2 hours/day. Despite not sleeping, the patient would appear active throughout the day. He also became more talkative and would constantly talk about his mother. He would also appear authoritative to his family members and order them to follow his instructions. He would be constantly engaged in household chores, even when they had already been done by his wife. His predominant mood was irritable, and he would have anger outbursts. He would try to go out of the house despite the lockdown, saying that he was going to the Prime Minister’s office to instruct him on how to control the pandemic. If family members stopped him, he would try to run out of the house and become verbally aggressive.

Successful outcomes of surgical treatment for acute arterial occlusion after TKA have been frequently reported in the literature; however, few reports have described conservative treatment. This case report describes the successful conservative treatment of popliteal artery occlusion after TKA. We report 2 cases of popliteal artery occlusion after TKA that were managed with conservative treatment. In Case 1, a 68-year-old woman presented with a weak dorsalis pedis pulse in the foot and weakness to dorsiflexion of the toe on the operative side immediately after TKA. The operative lower extremity arterial ultrasonography and computed tomography angiography demonstrated the popliteal artery occlusion.

Thus, conservative treatments were chosen, and anticoagulant and vasodilator therapies were undergone in both patients.

He has a past medical history of PAD, coronary artery disease, carotid stenosis, hypertension, prostate cancer, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, COPD, recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding and end-stage renal disease dependent on hemodialysis. His prior surgeries include coronary artery bypass grafting, bilateral carotid endarterectomy, esophagogastroduodenoscopy with clipping, automatic implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement and tunneled dialysis catheter placement. He also had a history of a femoral–femoral bypass with PTFE and subsequent left-sided femoral–popliteal bypass with PTFE. In 2005, he presented with acute limb ischemia of the left lower extremity (LLE) requiring open thrombectomy and endarterectomy of the distal anastomosis site of the femoral–popliteal bypass and repair with Vascu-Guard patch angioplasty. He now presents to our office with pain in the left posterior knee as well as below the knee swelling of the LLE. On physical exam, he had a large pulsatile mass of the posterior knee, the popliteal vessel had a palpable pulse and Doppler signals were present in the left posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis vessels; no motor or sensory deficits were present. Initial workup included an ultrasound (US) of the LLE to rule out a deep vein thrombosis and Duplex US for graft surveillance. Results of the imaging studies revealed left proximal graft stenosis >75% and a large arterial aneurysm in the medial mid left thigh at the site of pain, which appears to be at site of distal arterial graft. The decision was made to perform a CT angiography of the abdominal aorta with bilateral lower extremity runoff for further evaluation of the lower extremity anatomy and PA (Fig. 1). The results of the CT angiography showed a patent femoro–popliteal bypass graft and a PA, which measures 8 × 5.6 cm (Fig. 2) at the distal anastomosis compressing the popliteal artery (Fig. 3). Due the patient's multiple comorbidities and prior surgeries, the decision was made to repair the PA via an endovascular approach. The patient was taken to the vascular catheter laboratory and underwent LLE arteriogram with exclusion of the LLE PA with an 11 × 10 mm Viabahn stent. He underwent balloon angioplasty of the popliteal vessel and placement of a 6 × 80 mm Bard life stent. Completion arteriogram was performed and showed adequate runoff, pulse exam was comparable to preoperative examination with monophasic Doppler signals. The bypass entry site was closed via cut down and interrupted 5-0 Prolene suture. The PA was then aspirated with the Cook introducer needle; 20 cc of serous fluid and 60 cc of old non-pulsatile blood were aspirated. The operative site was closed in a layered fashion and the patient was maintained on a heparin drip as bridge to warfarin (Coumadin) and received a 300-mg clopidogrel (Plavix) bolus. Postoperatively, the heparin drip was continued until his international normalized ratio (INR) was therapeutic. On postoperative day (POD) 3, he was found to have a small hematoma at the femoral–femoral bypass access site, the heparin drip was held and a sandbag was applied to the area. On POD 4, his INR was therapeutic and the hematoma was non-expanding or pulsatile, the decision was made to discharge home.\n\n\n", "pmid": "27994009", "journal_title": "N/A", "PubDate_year": null, "PubDate_month": null, "PubDate_date": null}, {"rank": 10, "score": 188.4788, "title": "Loss of Distal Femur Combined with Popliteal Artery Occlusion: Reconstructive Arthroplasty Using Modular Segmental Endoprosthesis: A Case Report", "text": "Paramedics brought a 45-yr-old man into our medical center immediately after a high-velocity crush injury.

DH is classified as a cutaneous manifestation of coeliac disease, a type of gluten-sensitive enteropathy (1). The treatment of DH includes dapsone and a gluten-free diet (GFD). Other therapies should be considered in patients who are unable to tolerate dapsone, including sulfapyridine and glucocorticoids. Herein we present two cases of DH with good responses to tetracycline and niacinamide combination therapy. Case 1 was a 42-year-old man who was admitted to our hospital with a 3-year history of recurrent pruritic papules and bullous lesions involving the trunk and upper limbs. On examination, the patient showed disseminated erythematous papules on the upper limbs and back as well as vesicles. Nikolsky's sign for vesicles was negative (Figure 1, a-c). The results of routine blood examinations were within normal ranges. He did not have a history of chronic diarrhea. The histologic examination showed subepidermal blisters and accumulation of neutrophils at the papillary dermis of the involved ski. Direct immunofluorescence revealed fibrillar deposition of IgA on the dermal papillae (Figure 1. g, h). Case 2 was a 34-year-old woman who had a history of skin rash and pruritic lesions predominantly involving the arms and legs, which had been present for 10 months. She had been treated with prednisone (30 mg daily) with improvement; however, the lesions reappeared when the prednisone was discontinued. She had a history of constipation. On physical examination, the skin lesions manifested as erythematous papules, vesicles, and scabs on the limbs (Figure 2. a-c). She felt apparently pruritic. The histologic examination of the biopsy identified subepidermal blisters with a neutrophil infiltrate in the upper dermis. Direct immunofluorescence revealed granular deposition of IgA on the dermal papillae (Figure 2. e, f). The results of routine blood examinations were within normal ranges, with the exception of elevated IgE concentration (222.5 ku/L (normal range, 0-100 ku/L)). The clinical manifestations and histologic and immunofluorescence examinations of the two cases confirmed the diagnosis of DH. The two patients were subsequently started on a strict GFD. At that time, dapsone was not available in the hospital. The patients were treated with oral tetracycline (500 mg four times daily) and nicotinamide (500 mg three times daily). The rash affecting case 1 resolved entirely in 2 weeks. The patient discontinued the medications after 6 months, and occasionally presented with a few pruritic papules and vesicles, but the lesions resolved within 1 week. The lesions affecting case 2 completely healed within 1 month. The patient continued taking those medications and no recurrence of the skin lesions occurred during 2 years of follow-up. Dapsone is considered first-line therapy for patients with DH (2). Recent findings have shown dapsone and lower dosages of sulfasalazine combination therapy in DH are effective and well-tolerated (3). Alternative monotherapeutic agents in mild autoimmune bullous diseases such as DH include a tetracycline group of antibiotics with niacinamide or its derivatives as well as sulfasalazine. Because dapsone is difﬁcult to obtain in China except for patients with leprosy, we treated the patients with tetracycline and nicotinamide. To our knowledge, only a few cases of DH have been successfully treated with oral tetracycline and niacinamide (2,4). One of the patients was also prescribed heparin (4). Tetracycline has anti-inflammatory properties due to the inhibition of metalloproteinase activity and mast cell activation (5). Nicotinamide is a potent modulator of several pro-inflammatory cytokines. Nicotinamide can inhibit cytokine release (IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-α) from immune cells, inhibit chemotaxis and degranulation of immune cells, inhibit lymphocyte blast transformation, and suppress T-cell activity (6). The non-antibiotic properties of tetracycline in combination with nicotinamide may participate in inhibition of antibody formation, modulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, inﬂammatory cell accumulation, lymphocyte transformation, and T-cell activation. In summary, we reported two typical cases of DH that were successfully treated with oral tetracycline and niacinamide, which completely healed the rash and relieved the symptoms within 1 month. The combination of tetracycline and nicotinamide can be recommended as a useful therapy for patients where dapsone is not available or for patients who do not tolerate dapsone.", "pmid": "", "journal_title": "Medicine", "PubDate_year": null, "PubDate_month": null, "PubDate_date": null}, {"rank": 8, "score": 81.266014, "title": "Development, Validation and Implementation of Continuous Professional Development Programmes for Community Pharmacists", "text": "The KAP questionnaire consisted of a total of 20 questions.

In neonatal hemophilia B mice, a single neonatal injection of Ad-E4-122aT expressing human FIX (hFIX) (Ad-E4-122aT-AHAFIX) maintained more than 6% of the normal plasma hFIX activity levels for approximately 100 days. Sequential administration of Ad-E4-122aT-AHAFIX resulted in more than 100% of the plasma hFIX activity levels for more than 100 days and rescued the bleeding phenotypes of hemophilia B mice. In addition, immunotolerance to hFIX was induced by Ad-E4-122aT-AHAFIX administration in neonatal hemophilia B mice. These results indicated that Ad-E4-122aT is a promising gene delivery vector for neonatal or infant gene therapy for hemophilia B.", "pmid": "", "journal_title": "Diagnostic and interventional radiology (Ankara, Turkey)", "PubDate_year": null, "PubDate_month": null, "PubDate_date": null}, {"rank": 9, "score": 121.01175, "title": "", "text": "Introduction Fetoscopic release of amniotic bands has proved its life- and limb-saving potential. Rupture of the amnion and separation of chorion from the amnion and uterine wall can however preclude the standard fetoscopic approach to release the amniotic bands using a single port. Methods and Materials A 28-year-old G1P0 woman was referred to our unit at 19 weeks due to amniotic band syndrome involving the left ankle, the infrapatellar region of the right leg, and the umbilical cord. Of note, part of the fetus was seen outside the amniotic cavity by ultrasonography and the left ankle and foot were severely swollen. The patient underwent a laparotomy and fetoscopic release of the amniotic bands as well as partial amnionectomy using two uterine ports and CO2 as distention. Results The surgery and postoperative recovery course were uneventful. At 341/7 weeks the patient went into labor, which was augmented resulting vaginal delivery of a 2,460-g male infant. The infant was noted to have a shallow skin indentation on the left lower extremity near the ankle. The infant was discharged in excellent condition. Conclusion In those cases where release of an amniotic band is impossible due to membrane separation, surgery in a CO2-filled uterus offers an option.

But then, she could also have been referring to David Hume (1711–1776), who resurrected Shakepeare’s term in his famous essay “On Suicide” (1783/1995, #8). Hume points out that suicide can even be experienced as a “remedy” if death is perceived only as a “horror”, or, as Hume himself claims in his Treatise, death is perceived as ultimate annihilation removing all perceptions p. 165). It is, as Hume argues, the effectiveness with which death “free him from all danger or misery” that makes it a “remedy” in the eyes of the desperate person, claiming that “no man ever threw away life while it was worth keeping” (1783/1995, #8).

If compensatory water intake cannot be maintained, either due to loss of thirst perception (adipsic DI) or no access to water, severe dehydration and altered mental status will develop. Laboratory findings are usually remarkable for high serum osmolality (>295 mosmol/kg) along with a low or inappropriate normal urinary osmolality (<100 mosmol/kg). Unlike the reported case, which already presented with obvious laboratory abnormalities, DI diagnosis is usually established after a medically supervised water deprivation test. The latter involves serial measurement of patient’s weight, urine volume and osmolality along with plasma sodium and water after cessation of fluid intake in a controlled setting. A rise in serum osmolality without an accompanying rise of urine osmolality is diagnostic of DI. To further differentiate central from nephrogenic DI, a desmopressin challenge test is recommended. Desmopressin is a synthetic formulation of antidiuretic hormone and physiologically favors renal urinary concentrating properties. In central DI, desmopressin is expected to induce an increment in urine osmolality (more than 50% of baseline) that supports an absolute ADH deficiency and adequate renal response to the peptide. On the other hand, the lack of urine osmolality response (U-osmol rise of less than 10%) favors renal unresponsiveness to ADH and nephrogenic DI.

Insulin therapy represents a cornerstone in the treatment of diabetes and has been used widely for achieving glycemic goals.

Moreover, insulin treatment, especially if intensive, may be associated with emergency room visits and hospitalization due to hypoglycemic events. Therefore, fear of hypoglycemia or hypoglycemic events represents the main barriers to the attainment of glycemic targets. The burden associated with multiple daily injections also remains a significant obstacle to initiating and maintaining insulin therapy. The most attractive insulin treatment approach should meet the patients’ preference, rather than demanding patients to change or adapt their lifestyle. Insulin degludec/insulin aspart (IDegAsp) is a new combination, formulated with ultra-long-acting insulin degludec and rapid-acting insulin aspart, with peculiar pharmacological features, clinical efficacy, safety, and tolerability. IDegAsp provides similar, noninferior glycemic control to a standard basal–bolus regimen in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, with additional benefits of significantly lower episodes of hypoglycemia (particularly nocturnal) and fewer daily insulin injections. Moreover, although treatment strategy and patients’ viewpoint are different in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, trial results suggest that IDegAsp may be an appropriate and reasonable option for initiating insulin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on maximal doses of conventional oral agents.

Crizotinib and alectinib share the same targeted molecule and disease, but their companion diagnostic test requirements are different.

Such a ‘tragicomedy’ should be scientifically considered and avoided for the benefit of patients.

When an agonist binds to the α1-receptor, phospholipase C is activated and inositol trisphosphate (IP3) is produced. This IP3 through binding to the IP3 receptor can release Ca2+ from sarcoplasmic reticulum, leading to a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, which contracts blood vessel. On the other hand, cAMP concentration in the cell rises due to the activation of adenylate cyclase when an agonist binds to the β2-receptor. This rise in cAMP concentration activates protein kinase A (PKA), which relaxes blood vessel. Thus, in vascular smooth muscle, α1-adrenergic action induces vasoconstriction, while β2-adrenergic action induces vasorelaxation. In this study, we reveled that A484954 (10 µM) inhibited an α1- and β2-adrenergic receptor agonist, NA-induced contraction in a biphasic manner, while an inhibitory effect of A484954 on a selective α1-receptor agonist, phenylephrine-induced contraction was not biphasic.

As such, the dose of clonidine may not have been sufficient to elicit a significant difference in pupil reactivity.

The cell cycle is the overall process of the cell from the beginning of a division to the end of the next division that allows the cell to proliferate, and is divided into four consecutive phases, known as G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases. Although G0 is often referred to as the quiescent phase, G0-phase cells are still quite with respect to cellular growth and are strictly regulated to determine when the cell will enter other stages of the cell cycle. The mitogenic signaling mediated by the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathway promotes this shift, whose endpoint is the stimulation of D-type cyclin production. Our study suggested that ailanthone induces cell cycle arrest of HL-60 cells at the G0/G1 phase. In addition, a previous study found that ailanthone significantly induced cell cycle arrest at the G1/S phase in Huh-7 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. In eukaryotic cells, the process of G2/M cell cycle is regulated by protein B (cyclinB)-p34cdc2, G2/M phase arrest takes place mainly in a p53-dependent manner. Watson et al, investigated a p53 wild-type MCF-7 cell line and p53 mutated MDA-MB-231 cell line. They found that the cell cycle of p53 wild-type MCF-7 cell line was arrested at the G1 and G2 phases under ionizing radiation, while p53 mutated MDA-MB-231 cells were arrested at the G2/M phase. Drug-induced cell cycle modulation not only varies between the same cell line treated with different drugs, but also in different cells after treatment with the same drug. Lavhale et al, found ailanthus excelsa chloroform extract-1 extracted from Ailanthus excels could induce S/G2-M cell cycle arrest in MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, and PC3 cells and a G1 arrest in B16F10 cells. Treatment with AECHL-1 results in a significant decrease in the levels of c-Myc, CDK-4, and cyclin D1 in B16F10 cells, while the expression level of p21 was increased. p21 forms a complex with CDK2/CDK4/CDK6 and inhibits the CDK-cyclin kinase activity phase and arrests cells in the G1 phase. Therefore, we believe that the induction of cell cycle arrest at different phase by compounds extracted from ailanthus may be associated with a variety of factors, such as mutation of p53 gene and expression level of p21 in tumor cells and so on. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that the anti-proliferative effects of ailanthone on HL-60 cells were partially due to the induction of apoptosis and G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest.", "pmid": "30127963", "journal_title": "N/A", "PubDate_year": null, "PubDate_month": null, "PubDate_date": null}, {"rank": 3, "score": 114.1739, "title": "Development of nanoscale drug delivery systems of dihydroartemisinin for cancer therapy: A review", "text": "Uncontrolled cell proliferation is a typical property of cancers that occurs as a result of the overexpression and aberrant activity of cell cycle proteins such as cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Therefore, prevention of cell cycle progression (G1/G0-S-G2-M) through cycle arrest in cancer cells is an effective method for inhibiting tumor growth. DHA treatment can induce cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 or G2/M phase by regulating cyclin-related pathways, thus stopping cell division and inhibiting tumor proliferation. For example, DHA induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in pancreatic cancer cells via downregulation of the cyclin E, CDK2, CDK4 and CDK6 proteins. Likewise, DHA induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in gastric carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo by negatively regulating the cyclin D1-CDK4-Rb signaling pathway. Similar results of an increased G0/G1 population after DHA treatment were also observed in breast cancer colorectal cancerand glioma. The antiproliferative effect of DHA is also associated with G2/M phase cell cycle arrest accompanied by upregulation of p21 and downregulation of cyclinB, CDC25B and CDC25C]. In particular, DHA inhibits epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cell growth by inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest without inducing apoptosis, which suggests the critical role of DHA in EOC cell cycle control. In some cases, DHA synergistically inhibits cell proliferation when combined with other therapeutic agents.

Under irradiation-mediated genotoxic stress, increased DNA-DSB challenges the stability of genomic DNA and the DNA repair capacity determines the cell survival and the radiosensitivity of cancer cells. Under irradiation, DNA damage is sensed by DNA-PK/ATM and ATM-related kinase (ATR)-mediated signaling. The activation of this signaling promotes p53 phosphorylation and activates p53-mediated responses. The DNA damage checkpoints, including G2/M phase, S phase and G0-S transition checkpoints, are sensitive to and responsible for irradiation-mediated DNA damage. The p53-dependent p21 phosphorylation promoted cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase by inhibiting cyclin D1, cyclin E and CDK2, while G2/M cell cycle arrest was induced by decreased cyclin B and Chk2/cell division cycle 25C (Cdc25C)/Cdc2, which was negatively regulated by p53-dependent GADD45 expression8).

MLPA analysis using SALSA® MLPA® Probemix P140‐C1 HBA (MRC‐Holland) showed a heterozygous deletion involving part of the alpha‐globin cluster, with absence of probes on HBA2 gene (Figure 1B). For interpretation of results, we used MLPA tables that show expected probe ratios for a selected subset of copy number changes and polymorphisms, for common and uncommon alpha‐globin gene cluster mutations. For this case, table of expected probe ratios for common HBA deletion types was selected:value of ratio equal to 1 indicates the presence of both alleles, a ratio of 0.5 the loss of one allele and 0 the loss of that probe in both alleles. Three probes are non‐specific and detect sequences present in both HBA1 and HBA2 genes. In these cases, a ratio of 1 indicates the presence of the two genes in both alleles, a ratio of 0.75 the presence of one gene in both allele and one gene only in one allele, a ratio of 0.5 can represent or the presence of the two genes in cis, two genes on only one allele and the deletion of both genes on the other allele (α°), or the presence of the two genes in trans, one on an allele and one on the other allele (α+). A ratio of 0.25 is linked to the presence of only one gene on one allele and the deletion of the other gene for both alleles while a ratio of 0 indicates the deletion of both genes in both alleles. Considering proband values of ratio, we supposed the presence of the two of the most common α‐thalassemia deletions in HBA2 gene, the −3.7 kb on one allele and the −4.2 kb deletion on the other allele. Segregation study on the patient's parents was performed and showed that her mother carried the −3.7 kb deletion while patient's father was compound heterozygous for both deletions as the proband. We could not analyze the two sisters (Figure 1A). Multiplex Gap‐polymerase chain reaction (Multiplex Gap‐PCR), the most common method used to screen for common deletions causing α‐thalassemia,confirmed the presence of these deletions, showing that the proband and her father present the two common deletions, the −3.7 kb on one allele and the −4.2 kb deletion on the other allele (−α3.7/−α4.2), which are rarely reported in combination, while the proband mother was heterozygous for the −3.7 kb deletion (−α3.7/αα) (Figure 1C).", "pmid": "", "journal_title": "N/A", "PubDate_year": null, "PubDate_month": null, "PubDate_date": null}, {"rank": 8, "score": 133.72008, "title": "Effects of –3.7α Deletion and Sickle-Cell Trait on Ventilatory and Hemodynamic Responses to Maximum Exercise in Young Saudi Females", "text": "α-Thalassemia is also highly prevalent in the same regions of Saudi Arabia.

He has not been on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) since being diagnosed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV 2)-positive 11 years ago. The exquisite anal pain was constant, exacerbated by bowel motions and not relieved by opiate analgesia. There was no altered bowel habit but the fear of defaecation made him constipated and exacerbated the symptoms. There was no anal discharge or rectal bleeding on defaecation. He had no fever, night sweats, or anorexia but had lost weight significantly. He has a long history of severe anal pruritus which he believes precipitated the anal ulcer. Physical examination revealed a wasted man in great anal distress but with normal vital signs. Chest, cardiovascular and abdominal examinations were unremarkable. There was no soilage on inspection of the perineum and underclothes but perianal examination revealed excoriation and ichthycosis indicating long-standing pruritus. There was superficial scarring with macular patches from probable chronic herpetic simplex lesions. There was no characteristic visible posterior anal fissure or reactive perianal skin tag. A digital rectal examination was not done because of severe anal pain and spasm. He consented to examination under anaesthesia and appropriate surgical treatment. His haemoglobin level was 9 g/L but white blood cell and CD4 counts were not available. Under general anaesthesia, in the lithotomy position a digital rectal examination revealed a posterior broad based anal ulcer. Proctoscopy showed the ulcer commencing above the dentate line in the lower rectum and ending below at the anoderm just distal to the internal anal sphincter. It was associated with an induration over a swelling which expressed copious pus and faeces on pressure into the intersphincteric space. There was no external opening into the anal skin. With the aid of the Eisenhamer retractor, the ulcer cavity was demonstrated as secondarily extending in a horse-shoe manner in the intersphincteric and submucosal planes consistent with an HIV ulcer (Figure 1). The differential diagnosis included an idiopathic anal fissure with a complicating abscess in an HIV-positive patient, an sexually transmitted disease (STD)–associated anogenital ulcer, anorectal abscess from an acutely infected intersphincteric anal gland and anal malignancy (carcinoma, lymphoma or Kaposi sarcoma). In a resourced area, biopsy would identify the treatable aetiology. The cavity was deroofed, debrided and irrigated with normal saline until brisk bleeding ensued. A minimal lateral internal sphincterotomy using the open method relieved the ensuing anal spasm. Apart from postoperative bleeding and the continuing discharge of pus that settled, he had instant pain relief. Because of a possible herpetic aetiology of the ulcer, he was commenced on acyclovir 200 mg bd for two weeks. He was discharged on the fifth postoperative day and was advised sitz baths and good perianal hygiene. Follow-up at six weeks showed an appreciative patient with a minimally painful healing anal ulcer and satisfactory anal continence.\n", "pmid": "26266040", "journal_title": "N/A", "PubDate_year": null, "PubDate_month": null, "PubDate_date": null}, {"rank": 4, "score": 263.86765, "title": "Chlamydial Proctitis in a Young Man Who Has Sex with Men: Misdiagnosed as Inflammatory Bowel Disease", "text": "A 20-year-old man presented with anorectal pain and bloody rectal discharge for 2 months.

We are unaware of any documented cases of jaw tremor producing bodily injury. We now report an 86-year-old female diagnosed with ET in her early 70s; her symptoms had begun at age 71. In August 2015, she was enrolled and consented to be a participant in a clinical research study approved by the Yale University Ethics Committee. At that time, she reported no family history of ET. By history, the tremor involved her arms, head, jaw, and voice, with marked jaw tremor being a major issue. On examination, there was mild postural tremor and moderate-to-severe kinetic tremor of both arms, with head and voice tremors. There was also a prominent jaw tremor. Additional history was as follows: by 2014, her jaw tremor had become so severe that she described her teeth as clicking continuously, at times forcefully striking against one another. The first catastrophic event occurred in September 2014. Her jaw movements had become severe and she broke her first right upper bicuspid tooth; a crown was introduced as a result of this. A second episode occurred soon after when she broke that crown and her adjacent canine tooth, for which she required a bridge. After that episode, she was placed on primidone, eventually reaching a dose of 250 mg/day, with a consequent marked (>50%) reduction in jaw tremor (Video 1).

The patient was born from a planned pregnancy with no reported medical history during the perinatal or postnatal period. The patient experienced numerous traumatic events starting from his childhood, with both parents engaging in severe conflicts that resulted in a two-way domestic assault over the course of their marriage. The patient recalls his parents fighting before his eyes when he was approximately 5 years old, when his father threw an electric fan at his mother, which knocked her unconscious as it struck her head. He remembers heading to the hospital with his mother in an ambulance, trembling with fear of the possibility of his mother dying from the injury. His parents had divorced when he was about 8 years of age; for a few months following the divorce, the patient kept his eyes closed at all times, except when he was walking on the road or eating his meals. He has been bullied at school since the 1st grade, with most of his school life being spent in solitude. When he was approximately 11 years of age, the patient had witnessed his alcohol-intoxicated mother stabbing herself in the abdomen with a knife in their house. When he was about 13 years of age, the patient spent most of his time playing mobile games at home, excluding the time when he was at school. He had gotten into conflict with his mother regarding this issue, with verbal arguments escalating to the point of his mother throwing and breaking his phone repeatedly on multiple occasions. As the patient quarreled with his mother over his phone, the situation sometimes escalated to the point of his mother strangling the patient’s throat or beating his mother until she had black eyes. When he was about 15 years of age (1 year prior to visiting our clinic), the patient started experiencing auditory hallucinations of three beings talking to him: someone who tells the patient to kill, another who tells the patient to kill himself, and a third one who tries to stop these two beings. The patient killed his pet turtle by chopping it with a knife, and he also caught wild pigeons from the roadside to stab them to death. Reacting to the auditory hallucinations, the patient engaged in self-harm by injuring his thighs with a knife and attempted to commit suicide by jumping from the roof of his school. Subsequently, he visited a different psychiatric clinic and started pharmacotherapy with antipsychotics and antidepressants, from the impressions of schizophrenia and depression. Although the patient faithfully followed the medication regimen, the symptoms of auditory hallucinations did not improve. Six months prior to visiting our clinic, he reacted to a voice that told him to kill a person and tried to stab his friend—who was next to him at the time—with a pen. Due to this incident, he was admitted to a closed ward of a different psychiatric clinic to receive a 2-week inpatient treatment. While the auditory hallucinations seemed to have improved since hospitalization, the patient started hearing auditory hallucinations again, starting from 3 months prior to visiting our clinic. The auditory hallucinations tended to occur when the patient was at crowded places, where the three beings—one male, one female, and one unidentified being—would start talking to him with words such as “Kill. If you do not want to, die.” Despite having increased the dosage of his medication, his auditory hallucinations did not improve to the point where the patient started to leave early from school on more frequent occasions, being unable to eat even a single bite of his school lunch. Two weeks prior to visiting our clinic, the patient’s mother handed the patient a knife as she said, “If you are going to make me suffer so, why don’t you rather just kill me,” while she was intoxicated with alcohol.

Multiple non-prescription treatment options are available for managing these symptoms, including antacids, alginates, histamine-H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs), and proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). As a result, pharmacists are ideally positioned to recommend appropriate treatment options based upon an individual’s needs and presenting symptoms, prior treatment response, comorbid medical conditions, and other relevant factors. Individuals who experience mild heartburn and/or have symptoms that occur predictably in response to known precipitating factors can manage their symptoms by avoiding known triggers and using on-demand antacids and/or alginates or lower-dose non-prescription H2RAs (e.g. ranitidine 150 mg). For those with moderate symptoms, lifestyle changes, in conjunction with higher-dose non-prescription H2RAs, may be effective. However, for individuals with moderate-to-severe symptoms that occur frequently (i.e. ≥2 days/week), the non-prescription (Schedule II) PPI omeprazole 20 mg should be considered. The pharmacist can provide important support by inquiring about the frequency and severity of symptoms, identifying an appropriate treatment option, and recognizing other potential causes of symptoms, as well as alarm features and atypical symptoms that would necessitate referral to a physician. After recommending an appropriate treatment, the pharmacist can provide instructions for its correct use. Additionally, the pharmacist should inquire about recurrences, respond to questions about adverse events, provide monitoring parameters, and counsel on when referral to a physician is warranted.

The second option was cesarean section, preserving the uterus, and then hepatectomy in one operation. The third option was a cesarean section, hysterectomy if the uterus had a poor contraction, and left hepatectomy in one operation. In the first option, in terms of obstetrics, it could be safer for the fetus and mother because the patient underwent a cesarean section only, so the risk of blood loss was low. However, the patient must undergo further surgery for hepatectomy. During that time, the tumor may have ruptured or metastasized. Therefore, most of our team member did not agree with this option. In our opinion, if the patient had signs of fetal poisoning, placental abruption, blood clotting disorders, or severe combined internal disease (such as heart failure and kidney failure), the first option should be chosen to ensure the safety of both the mother and child. In the second and third options, there was a consensus that a cesarean section should be combined with hepatectomy.

Pseudoparalysis was defined as active forward flexion less than or equal to 90° with full passive forward flexion, with loss of a stable glenohumeral fulcrum. When symptomatic, patients often have night pain and with motion above the scapular plane. Pain is considered dependent on the inflammatory status and of the integrity of the long head of the biceps tendon (LHBT). Failure of conservative measures and quality-of-life impact may lead to a surgical option. Other symptoms include weakness and impaired ROM. As said previously, Collin et al. described that the tear pattern will more likely lead to a pseudo paralytic shoulder. These authors consider the superior two-thirds of the subscapularis that ends into a tendon in its attachment to the lesser tuberosity and the inferior third that remains muscular in its insertion as two separate units that balance the action of the two external rotators, the infraspinatus, and teres minor. In the present study, active ROM was significantly different between patients with type A (supraspinatus and superior SST) having ROM above shoulder level, whereas 80% of patients with type B (supraspinatus and complete SST) tears had a pseudo paralytic shoulder. This leads to the conclusion that tears involving the supraspinatus and superior half of SST can be compensated by other muscles and that this is not possible if all SST is involved. Other tear patterns such as type C (superior SST, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus) with 50% of patients with pseudoparalysis and type E (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, and teres minor) with 33% of pseudoparalysis demonstrate that dysfunction of three rotator cuff muscles is a risk factor for pseudoparalysis.

However, over the decade there has been great acceleration in the advancement of modern molecular techniques and the compilation of genomic data of many pathogens. Such advances provide a great opportunity to create desirable vaccine strains which are less dangerous but more effectively immunogenic than those of vaccines achieved by classical methods. It is well established that the immune system has several effector mechanisms to cope with various pathogens, which would be dependent on their lifecycle and the microenvironment of the infected host. Since killed vaccines are still mainly used for livestock, it is absolutely necessary to develop novel adjuvants in order to enhance satisfactory immunity for such vaccines. Potent adjuvants should be able to effectively elicit cellular immunity in animals that are vaccinated with less immunogenic vaccines including killed or subunit vaccines. The other way to resolve this issue would be to develop a new delivery system, such as plasmid DNA, liposome, microparticles, and live viral or bacterial vectors, which can introduce vaccine antigens into intracellular compartments. Another notable advancement in immunology is the increased recognition on the major roles of innate immunity in vaccine adjuvant functions, which is often ignored despite their significant influence on vaccine developments.

The amplified virus may then evade clearance by host defences for long enough to be transmitted to another susceptible host, and the lack of herd immunity will result in a rapid dissemination of the virus, leading to disease in more virulent cases of infection. Each step in the process represents an opportunity for vaccine‐induced immunity and, through such intervention, transmitters and susceptible hosts are removed from a population by the pre‐emptive development of protective immunity, so that the spread of infection becomes less likely. Vaccination is therefore a powerful strategy for preventing and controlling emerging zoonotic infectious disease. The development of vaccines for such emerging infections, however, needs to contend with several key challenges associated with such viruses. An emerging infection may be a recently discovered virus and the result of a rare outbreak for which basic biological information such as correlates of protection, antigenic variability or immunodominance are unknown. There may be a lack of time to develop an appropriate animal model of disease in which to study viral immunology and evaluate vaccine candidates for preclinical assessment of protective efficacy and safety. Additionally, many emerging viruses have high case fatality rates, spread easily and cannot be treated. These characteristics mandate that all experimental investigations with such infectious material be carried out at high levels of bio‐safety, such as BioSafety levels 3 or 4. For such pathogens the availability of resource‐heavy laboratory infrastructure is a bottleneck to basic research. Moreover, the often standard vaccine approach of using attenuated strains or inactivated viral vaccines is not always a feasible option, because of the possibility of reversion to virulence or the requirement for large‐scale culture and production in high containment facilities. In addition to these significant hurdles, the economic cost of novel human vaccine development for rare pathogens, which are unlikely to provide an effective payback on investment, has been a major impediment to progress. Thus, basic research into many emerging pathogens has been neglected for years.", "pmid": "30993690", "journal_title": "N/A", "PubDate_year": null, "PubDate_month": null, "PubDate_date": null}, {"rank": 5, "score": 104.8314, "title": "Human immunodeficiency virus vaccine an update", "text": "There were five major vaccines introduced as possible treatments for AIDS: Killed vaccine, live-attenuated vaccine, subunit vaccine, vectored vaccine, and DNA vaccine.

Despite the safety concerns of the live attenuated vaccine, it is currently the only vaccine that is capable of inducing a protective immunity. Hence, a vaccine that has similar qualities and which induces a strong response of the immune system similar to that of the live attenuated vaccine is the most probable to become a successful AIDS vaccine. In order to develop an effective DNA vaccine, the vaccine candidate should be evaluated thoroughly in terms of protective immunity in a small number of volunteers before entering large-scale phase IIb~III efficacy trials. More importantly, even before considering any clinical trials in humans, the efficacy test should be evaluated in the appropriate SIV mac-rhesus macaque challenge model that closely resembles the human case.

Although attenuated bacteria are able to infect and multiply in the vaccinated host, they no longer are capable of causing clinical disease as the result of impairment of biological function of virulent determinants []. Immune reactions derived from vaccination with live bacteria last longer than those of immunity generated by inactivated bacteria. The major advantage of live vaccine is a broader scope and duration of protection because the animals are exposed to all stages of the replicating bacteria. However, it is critical to ensure that live bacterial vaccine is neither over- or under-attenuated in target animals. Whereas under-attenuated strains may be pathogenic and consequently causes their natural diseases, over-attenuation would not elicit enough amount of an immune response to be an effective vaccine]. Since live bacteria vaccines can elicit good levels of both humoral and cellular immunity, this property per se makes live vaccines highly desirable. Creation of live bacterial vaccine strains followed by a classical method would be achieved by conducting multiple passages of microorganisms in suitable systems and by selecting desirable mutants. This method is readily applicable for most target pathogens to be created as attenuated vaccine strains. However, there has been relatively little success in developing attenuated bacteria by such a classical method. For this reason, relatively mild selective pressure on bacteria during in vitro passage enables bacteria to temporarily suppress virulence determinants and then restart their expression of such determinants in vivo. Once development of such vaccines were not technically feasible for most bacteria due to lack of proper tools for doing so, however, currently advanced genetic techniques make practical the development of attenuated strains. This strategy provides opportunities to create desirable mutants of various types of bacteria, through manipulating a target gene with various genetic techniques, including gene-insertion, deletion, disruption, replacement, and point mutation. The best targets for a bacterial genome are the genes associated with virulence determinants, biosynthesis, and regulatory genes which are critical for bacterial survival. Interestingly, from the standpoint of creating a vaccine strain, deletion of virulence-associated genes in bacteria may be problematic since protective immunity is sometimes desired against the very virulence-associated protein. In such a case, this strain cannot provide good immunity as a vaccine strain. Chemically altered bacterial vaccine contains modified bacteria that have been grown in media supplemented with the proper level of a chemical that provokes mutation of bacteria, changing the ability of bacteria to cause diseases. This method would be another option for developing weakened bacteria and followed by a proper screening method that is suitable for selecting desirable mutants. Alternatively, temperature sensitive mutants can be generated by selection of the mutants which lost their ability to grow at animal body's temperature but can grow at the temperature present in ocular or nasal cavity. In general, killed vaccines for Salmonella are able to stimulate strong immune response, but offer a relatively low degree of protection as compared to live attenuated vaccine. They are also difficult to apply to large flocks, requiring a lot of labor for vaccination [].

Studies of pathogenesis have established the importance of specific ligand-receptor interactions between the enteropathogens and the intestinal epithelium, resulting in attachment and colonization of the bacteria and production of disease through either invasive mechanisms or production of toxins. Studies of protective immune mechanisms have emphasized the importance of secretory IgA antibodies and mucosal memory for protection against noninvasive, enterotoxigenic infections such as cholera and ETEC diarrhea and also drawn attention to the possible protective role of IFN-gamma production by intestinal T cells in these secretory diarrheas.

The systolic and diastolic blood pressures, controlled by amlodipine besylate (5 mg)/valsartan (160 mg), were 110-131 and 62-82 mmHg, respectively, at the time of admission. In particular, a preoperative electrocardiogram, echocardiogram and chest posteroanterior radiography at the time of admission were all within the normal limits. She was taking amlodipine besylate (5 mg)/valsartan (160 mg) at the time of admission. She had a past anesthetic history of receiving general anesthesia for an appendectomy approximately 1 year prior and did not have any specific family history of anesthesia. Amlodipine besylate/valsartan was omitted on the day of the operation. No premedication was given for sedation. Anesthesia was induced with thiopental sodium (250 mg), servoflurane (6 vol%) and rocuronium bromide (50 mg), and the patient received oxygen (100%) through a facemask. Orotracheal intubation was performed using a reinforced endotracheal tube (internal diameter: 7.0 mm). The left radial artery was cannulated using a 20-gauge catheter to monitor intraoperative blood pressure. Anesthesia was maintained with servoflurane (2-4 vol%) in oxygen (2 L/min). The patient's position was changed from supine to prone, and the patient was transferred to the table for CT. Fig. 1 shows the intraoperative blood pressure and heart rate for every 5 min interval. When the first radiofrequency wave for percutaneous CT-guided radiofrequency ablation was given to the reninoma using an adjustable active tip (Proteus radiofrequency ablation electrode; STARmed, Ilsan, Korea), the patient's heart rate transiently increased from 74 beats/min to 104 beats/min. When the next nine radiofrequency waves were given using a 2.5 to 3 cm active tip, the intraoperative systolic and diastolic blood pressures and heart rate were 71-84, 77-86, and 80-92% of the preoperative value, respectively. In other words, the intraoperative blood pressure and heart rate were relatively stable. Heart rate and systolic blood pressure transiently increased from 65 beats/min to 102 beats/min and from 96 mmHg to 114 mmHg, respectively, when the last CT was taken 5 min before the operation ended. Normal saline (300 ml) was intraoperatively infused, and the intraoperative urine output was estimated to be 70 ml. The operation ended uneventfully, without any of the reported possible complications, including perirenal hematoma, hematuria, ureteropelvic junction obstruction and liver burn []. The total time for both anesthesia and operation was approximately 2 hours. The patient was extubated after adequate self-respiration was confirmed and clear consciousness was observed. The blood pressure and heart rate at extubation were maintained at preanesthetic levels. The patient was transferred to a recovery room using a movable bed, and the patient's position was changed from prone to supine in the movable bed. Fig. 2 shows that stable blood pressure and heart rate were maintained by the patient for approximately 70 min in the postanesthetic recovery room. The patient was transferred to the general ward 70 min after the operation. Fig. 3 shows the blood pressure and heart rate of the patient when in the general ward. As shown in Fig. 3, the patient had a stable blood pressure and heart rate for the initial 3 hours and 15 min spent in the general ward. Intravenous pethidine was given 3 hours after the operation to control postoperative pain. Normal saline (300 ml) was infused for 5 hours after the operation, and then the patient had a soft meal. When the patient sat up from a lying position to eat a soft meal approximately 5 hours after the operation, the patient complained of severe dizziness. At that time, the systolic/diastolic blood pressure and heart rate were 89/46 mmHg and 82 beats/min, respectively. Then, normal saline (500 ml) was intravenously infused over 15 min, which increased the systolic/diastolic blood pressure to 111/63 mmHg and significantly improved the dizziness of the patient. Then, the patient received an intravenous infusion of normal saline (1 L) at a rate of 120 ml/hr during the remaining time spent in the general ward. The blood pressure of the patient was stable throughout the remaining period in the general ward, but mild dizziness still occurred. The patient was uneventfully discharged from the hospital 18 hours after the operation. Although the patient's blood pressure was within the normal limits, the patient suffered mild orthostatic dizziness for approximately 4 weeks after discharge. Although she did not take antihypertensive drugs after the operation, her systolic and diastolic blood pressures at home were within the normal limits. At 1 month after the operation, the mild dizziness completely resolved and renin and angiotensin II levels were within the normal limits, but angiotensin I remained slightly increased (Table 1).", "pmid": "25664160", "journal_title": "N/A", "PubDate_year": null, "PubDate_month": null, "PubDate_date": null}, {"rank": 4, "score": 155.5053, "title": "A Case Demonstrating the Ribaroxaban Therapy for Paradoxical Embolism", "text": "A 67-year-old woman presented to our hospital with a 2-day history of pain and a feeling of coldness in her right hand.

The maintenance of anesthesia was done by desflurane 5.0-6.0%, 50% nitrous oxide and oxygen. The patient was maintained with a tidal volume of 8 ml/kg, and a respiratory rate of 10 breaths/min by the volume controlled mode. ECG, bispectral index (BIS), and pulse oximetry were performed, and a 20-gauge catheter was inserted in the right radial artery for continuous arterial pressure monitoring and a central venous catheter was inserted in the right internal jugular vein for the measurement of central venous pressure and for transfusion of fluids.

On admission, his blood pressure, pulse rate, body temperature, and oxygen saturation were 171/106 mm Hg, 170 beats/min, 37.2°C, and 84% (room), respectively. Physical examination revealed that bibasilar crackles were heard with no obvious heart murmur or jugular vein distention. Initial transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was notable for a left ventricular ejection fraction of 82% and mild transvalvular mitral regurgitation (MR) with an effective regurgitant orifice area of 16 mm2. Subsequent chest computed tomography examination revealed extensive bilateral infiltrates and pleural effusion. Despite elevated white blood cell count (14,600/μl) and serum C-reactive protein (7.9 mg/dl), 3 sets of blood cultures were all negative. He was initially diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia, which responded well to intravenous ceftriaxone. On hospital day 19, he developed sudden-onset dyspnea; chest radiography revealed bilateral pulmonary congestion (Figure 1A). Vital sign measurements showed a blood pressure of 140/81 mm Hg, heart rate of 98 beats/min, and oxygen saturation of 88% (room). Chest auscultation was remarkable for bilateral coarse crackles and a holosystolic murmur (4/6 intensity), maximal at the apex radiating to the axilla. TTE showed an eccentric, severe MR jet with a prolapsed posteromedial leaflet towards the lateral wall of the left atrium associated with an effective regurgitant orifice area of 41 mm2 and left ventricular ejection fraction of 79%. Right-sided cardiac catheterization revealed prominent v waves (30 mm Hg) on pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) tracing with a mean PCWP of 24 mm Hg.

The child has minor dysmorphic features, and growth and developmental delay. Chromosome analysis showed a small unbalanced chromosome translocation, with extra chromosomal material at the tip of chromosome 3. The cytogenetics laboratory requested blood samples from both parents for follow-up studies. The parents are divorced, and the mother has custody of the child. The relationship between the parents is hostile. The mother has been tested and has normal chromosomes without evidence of translocation. At today's visit, she reacts angrily when the issue of contacting the child's father for testing is raised. She states that he abandoned them and that he has no interest in his child. She refuses to cooperate in contacting the father, who could be a translocation carrier. You do not know the father, but an office worker told you that he lives in a nearby town. The mother says that he is living with a new girlfriend.

After BPD, serum levels of calcium and vitamin D were decreased and serum levels of PTH, BAP, and osteocalcin were increased. Bone turnover and mineralization were both increased. Mean osteoid volume (P < 0.0007) and bone formation rate in relation to bone volume (P < 0.02) were increased.

At a regular control visit 3 months earlier, her serum creatinine level had been 1.42 mg/dL. Her medical history included several episodes of urticaria provoked by certain antibiotics and a few episodes of unknown origin; the current admission, however, she denied use of novel drugs that could have provoked urticaria. At the same time, a urine culture confirmed a urinary infection caused by Escherichia coli. The general practitioner prescribed pipemidic acid for treatment of the urinary tract infection and levocetirizine for treatment of the urticaria. Despite this therapy, she experienced persistent urticaria and a fever of up to 38°C. Her clinical picture was complicated by development of frontal sinusitis. Clarithromycin was administered. She remained febrile in spite of this antibiotic treatment, but her urticaria disappeared. Because of her serum creatinine level of 4.58 mg/dL in the control laboratory tests, she was sent to a nephrologist. Physical examination on admission revealed pale skin with slight lower extremity edema. Her blood pressure was 180/100 mmHg, pulse rate was 92 beats/minute (regular sinus rhythm), and body temperature was 38.5°C. Other physical findings were unremarkable.

Urinalysis showed proteinuria (1.06 g/day), hematuria (12–15 erythrocytes per high-power field), and leukocyturia (10–12 leukocytes per high-power field) with no casts. Sputum, urine, and blood cultures showed no growth. Nasal and throat swabs indicated normal flora. Examination by an otolaryngologist showed bilateral acute frontal sinusitis, which was confirmed by X-ray (Figure 1). The chest X-ray was unremarkable. Ultrasound revealed normally sized kidneys (around 110 mm) with hyperechogenic parenchyma. Echocardiography was not performed. Ciprofloxacin was started immediately upon admission, but the patient’s inflammatory indices remained elevated. In addition, acute diarrhea (Clostridium difficile-negative) developed and was suspected to have been caused by the antibiotic therapy. An enzyme-linked immunoassay detected myeloperoxidase antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (MPO-ANCA) at 62 IU/mL (reference, <20 IU), whereas the antinuclear antibody titer was 1:160 and components of C3 and C4 were normal. Anti-double-stranded DNA and anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies were not detected. Hepatitis B surface antigen and serological tests for hepatitis C and HIV were negative. We performed a kidney biopsy to determine the etiology of the aggravated kidney function. The analysis showed 10 glomeruli: 2 were globally sclerotic and the others had cellular and fibrocellular crescent formations. Diffuse interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy with lymphocytic–monocytic infiltration and foci of eosinophil infiltration were present, but without granuloma formation (Figure 2).

He lived in Côte d’Ivoire for 20 years where his job allowed him to\nprovide support for his wife and children. His illness obliged him to go back to Burkina\nFaso and become inactive, and in fact, to depend on his family.

Too weak to work, Sidbenewende lost his financial autonomy while his wife\nacquired one by selling cooked meals. During the first moments, he received help from his\nrelatives, especially his wife as he recounted,When his wife saw his condition deteriorating, she encouraged him with\nheartwarming words to go for an HIV test, which turned out to be positive. Sidbenewende\ndecided to inform his wife and children immediately.Despite their promise, resentment and bitterness gradually emerged.\nSidbenewende’s wife accused him of the disease and that she felt betrayed.

The responsibility attributed to the\nsick person, or conversely the fact of considering him a victim, largely determines the\nhelp within the couple and in the family. The example, the case of Sidbenewende\nillustrates that because of the long separation from the children, they were much more\nattached to their mother and seemed to support the father’s rejection.Sidbenewende started receiving ARTs in 2006, but his exclusion from his\nfamily has affected him greatly.

The only support available to him was provided by nonprofit organization and\nvarious people who benefited from its care. However, Sidbenewende performed his personal\nchores such as cooking and washing of his clothes because his relatives feared of the\npossible contraction of the disease.

The patient was born from a planned pregnancy with no reported medical history during the perinatal or postnatal period. The patient experienced numerous traumatic events starting from his childhood, with both parents engaging in severe conflicts that resulted in a two-way domestic assault over the course of their marriage. The patient recalls his parents fighting before his eyes when he was approximately 5 years old, when his father threw an electric fan at his mother, which knocked her unconscious as it struck her head. He remembers heading to the hospital with his mother in an ambulance, trembling with fear of the possibility of his mother dying from the injury. His parents had divorced when he was about 8 years of age; for a few months following the divorce, the patient kept his eyes closed at all times, except when he was walking on the road or eating his meals. He has been bullied at school since the 1st grade, with most of his school life being spent in solitude. When he was approximately 11 years of age, the patient had witnessed his alcohol-intoxicated mother stabbing herself in the abdomen with a knife in their house. When he was about 13 years of age, the patient spent most of his time playing mobile games at home, excluding the time when he was at school. He had gotten into conflict with his mother regarding this issue, with verbal arguments escalating to the point of his mother throwing and breaking his phone repeatedly on multiple occasions. As the patient quarreled with his mother over his phone, the situation sometimes escalated to the point of his mother strangling the patient’s throat or beating his mother until she had black eyes. When he was about 15 years of age (1 year prior to visiting our clinic), the patient started experiencing auditory hallucinations of three beings talking to him: someone who tells the patient to kill, another who tells the patient to kill himself, and a third one who tries to stop these two beings. The patient killed his pet turtle by chopping it with a knife, and he also caught wild pigeons from the roadside to stab them to death. Reacting to the auditory hallucinations, the patient engaged in self-harm by injuring his thighs with a knife and attempted to commit suicide by jumping from the roof of his school. Subsequently, he visited a different psychiatric clinic and started pharmacotherapy with antipsychotics and antidepressants, from the impressions of schizophrenia and depression. Although the patient faithfully followed the medication regimen, the symptoms of auditory hallucinations did not improve. Six months prior to visiting our clinic, he reacted to a voice that told him to kill a person and tried to stab his friend—who was next to him at the time—with a pen. Due to this incident, he was admitted to a closed ward of a different psychiatric clinic to receive a 2-week inpatient treatment. While the auditory hallucinations seemed to have improved since hospitalization, the patient started hearing auditory hallucinations again, starting from 3 months prior to visiting our clinic. The auditory hallucinations tended to occur when the patient was at crowded places, where the three beings—one male, one female, and one unidentified being—would start talking to him with words such as “Kill. If you do not want to, die.” Despite having increased the dosage of his medication, his auditory hallucinations did not improve to the point where the patient started to leave early from school on more frequent occasions, being unable to eat even a single bite of his school lunch. Two weeks prior to visiting our clinic, the patient’s mother handed the patient a knife as she said, “If you are going to make me suffer so, why don’t you rather just kill me,” while she was intoxicated with alcohol.

This variant was considered “likely pathogenic” at the time of testing and was recently reclassified as a “pathogenic.” Significant family history includes the patient's mother, who has a personal history of hypermobility, mild scoliosis, high arched palate, and mitral valve prolapse, which are findings that may potentially be suggestive of Stickler syndrome (Figure 1). However, the patient's mother never sought a formal genetic evaluation or targeted testing for the patient's COL2A1 variant. The patient and her partner were planning to undergo preimplantation genetic testing for the familial variant of Stickler syndrome, when she spontaneously conceived. Subsequently, the patient desired to pursue prenatal diagnostic testing for the familial variant due to the 50% risk to the pregnancy. If affected, the patient voiced that she would terminate the pregnancy out of concern for intrafamilial variability of the condition. She recognized that she has a mild form of the disease and expressed concern for possibly having a child with a more severe phenotype. As such, a transvaginal chorionic villus sampling (CVS) was attempted at 12 weeks gestation but was unable to be completed due to a steep angle of the cervix. Transabdominal CVS was not attempted due to the posterior location of the placenta. Subsequently, amniocentesis was performed at 16 weeks gestation. Evaluation of the fetal chin at that time was normal. Results were negative for the maternal COL2A1 variant, concluding that the fetus did not have Stickler syndrome. Karyotype was also performed due to patient's advanced maternal age and was normal (46, XX). In the second trimester, the patient's blood was drawn for routine maternal serum alpha‐fetoprotein (MSAFP) screening, which was elevated at 4.44 Multiples of Median (MoM). However, amniocentesis revealed a normal level of amniotic fluid alpha‐fetoprotein (AF‐AFP) of 0.76 MoM. In conjunction with a normal fetal anatomy ultrasound, it was believed that the likely source of the increased MSAFP is placental in origin. Other etiologies of increased MSAFP may include, but are not limited to: maternal cystic fibrosis, for which the patient screened negative; Hepatitis, for which the patient screened negative for both Hepatitis B and C; and certain neoplasms including germ cell tumors and liver cancer, though MSAFP levels would be expected to be much higher. Cervical length screening was performed via transvaginal ultrasound at the time of the anatomy evaluation and was repeated at 23 weeks since the patient could be at risk for preterm delivery. The cervical length was normal at 37mm and 48 mm, respectively. The patient underwent growth ultrasound at 28 and 36 weeks of gestation to assess the fetal growth in the setting of elevated MSAFP and stickler syndrome. Fetal growth was normal. An appropriate mode of delivery was determined by a multidisciplinary team using a patient‐centered approach, including obstetrics, ophthalmology, maternal‐fetal medicine, and genetics. Unassisted vaginal delivery was determined to be safe despite the patient's ocular manifestations. At 39 weeks, the patient underwent an induction of labor. A 3,090 g female was born via spontaneous vaginal delivery. Apgar scores were 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 min, respectively. There were no maternal or neonatal complications. Blood loss was normal. Postpartum maternal visual disturbances were not reported. Patient was scheduled to follow‐up with her ophthalmologist postpartum.

The patient was diagnosed with endometrial cancer via office hysteroscopic biopsy. Increasing tumor size is one of the reasons that enable office hysteroscopy to detect endometrial cancer. In this case, we believe that small polyps suggestive of atypical hyperplasia and endometrial cancer that was revealed in the proliferative phase were the main reason for outpatient hysteroscopy. Lately, the number of patients with endometrial cancer is increasing in developed countries. There are a few methods for the treatment of advanced endometrial cancer. It is necessary to diagnose endometrial cancer early to ensure good prognosis. Although endometrial cancer with tumor formation can be easily diagnosed, it is difficult to diagnose it when it is in the early stages. Therefore, the negative predictive value of normal endometrial biopsy is low at 51%. Approximately 3% of endometrial cancer is missed because of blinded D&C. Some gynecologists used several types of hysteroscopic features of endometrial lesions for diagnosing malignancy, including irregularity of endometrial glands, polypoid pattern, uneven surface, and abnormal endometrial vessels. Additionally, some reports suggested that normal hysteroscopic findings do not prove the absence of endometrial lesion. It is necessary to perform endometrial biopsy when there is increased endometrial thickness, with abnormal bleeding. The use of blind sampling of endometrium, such as is done via D&C, is not an accurate method for diagnosing endometrial cancer. We surely can biopsy the malignant endometrial lesion with the use of hysteroscopy with directed biopsy. However, we did not detect endometrial lesion in the first hysteroscopy because of endometrial thickness in the secretory phase. Therefore, we performed office hysteroscopy and succeeded in biopsy of malignant endometrial lesion. One of the important advantages of office hysteroscopy is that this procedure does not need hospitalization and anesthesia. The patients can avoid from discomfort of going into the operating room. Therefore, this procedure is considered as minimally invasive and highly tolerable by the patients while still sufficiently accurate for diagnostic purposes. These factors explain why patients tend to prefer the diagnosis of endometrial cancer by office hysteroscopy. Another important point is that it is easier to schedule office hysteroscopy than hysteroscopy during hospitalization. In high volume hospitals such as ours, it is difficult to schedule surgical procedures when compared to a local hospital. We consider the ease of examination an important advantage of office hysteroscopy. In this case, it was difficult to detect minimal lesion in the secretory phase because the endometrial thickness hid the endometrial cancer. It is easy to schedule office surgery in the proliferative phase even if her menstruation is irregular. There are issues with diagnosing endometrial cancer using hysteroscopy. A previous report indicated that hysteroscopy could increase the probability of positive peritoneal cytology. However, hysteroscopy does not induce the risk of ovarian or abdominal metastasis. This result suggested that the iatrogenic peritoneal spillage cannot induce metastasis. In addition, there is the possibility that intracavitary pressure by hysteroscopic fluid induces iatrogenic peritoneal spillage of endometrial cells. No spillage has been reported to occur at pressures <70 mmHg. Another examination method for endometrial cancer is transvaginal ultrasonography. Berretta et al suggested that transvaginal ultrasonography is a useful method for assessing myometrial invasion by endometrial cancer. Other reports suggested that tumor size is a useful marker for the surgical staging of endometrial cancer.", "pmid": "32714537", "journal_title": "N/A", "PubDate_year": null, "PubDate_month": null, "PubDate_date": null}, {"rank": 7, "score": 101.88975, "title": "Regulation of steroid hormone receptors and coregulators during the cell cycle highlights potential novel function in addition to roles as transcription factors", "text": "The cell cycle consists of four main phases: DNA synthesis (S phase), mitosis (M phase) and two gap phases, G1 and G2. M phase itself is a complex phase, however, and contains five steps (prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase), followed by cytokinesis, in order to achieve an equal distribution of two sister chromatids into daughter cells, which later enter early G1 phase. Depending on the cell type and external environment/stimuli, cells can also enter a G0 phase, or quiescent state. A typical mammalian cell usually takes 24 hours to complete a cell cycle (~12 hours for G1, 6 hours for S phase, 6 hours for G2 and 30 minutes for M phase). To ensure faithful DNA synthesis and accurate cell division, cells have three important cell cycle checkpoints: G1/S checkpoint and G2/M checkpoint, and the spindle checkpoint in M phase. The whole cell cycle progression is timely and tightly regulated by various kinases. The sequential activation of complexes of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and their regulatory cyclins drives cell cycle progression. More specifically, cyclin D and cyclin E are increased at G1, while cyclin A and cyclin E are increased in S phase and cyclin B is an M phase cyclin. Meanwhile, CDK inhibitors (CKIs) negatively regulate CDK activities by binding and inactivating CDK–cyclin complexes. Furthermore, various mitotic kinases control the cell cycle through regulating centrosome function, spindle assembly, chromosome segregation, and cytokinesis [Fu, 2010]. The spatiotemporal phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of these kinases plays a key role in switching on and off signaling pathways to drive cell cycle progression and protect cells from cell cycle aberrations. For example, mitotic kinases such as Polo-like kinases (PLKs), Aurora kinases and Nek kinases regulate the centrosome cycle and mitotic spindle formation. Other kinases such as budding uninhibited by benomyl 1 (Bub 1) kinase and BubR1 (Bub1-related kinase), Aurora B and the kinetochore kinase Monopolar spindle 1 (Mps1) are involved in the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) pathway to ensure all chromosomes are correctly aligned at the metaphase plate before the onset of anaphase [].

However, various motivations for self-injurious behaviors as well as suicide attempts have been reported, especially in patients with psychotic illnesses. A 47-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia presented to our hospital due to the presence of a nail on his plain skull X-ray. He diagnosed paranoid type of schizophrenia about 17 years earlier, and his psychiatric symptoms were well controlled by medication. Interestingly, he was not aware of the presence of the nail in his brain and showed no neurological deficits. In the course of detailed history taking, we discovered that the nail was driven into his brain during a hallucinatory experience that had occurred more than 10 years earlier. Because we believed that removing the nail from his brain would be more dangerous than maintaining the status quo, the nail was not removed. This is a very rare case of a self-inflicted injury involving inserting a nail into the brain under the influence of hallucinations.
