Acting Justly The principle of justice provides guidance to physicians about how to ethically treat patients and to make decisions about allocating important resources, including their own time. Justice in a general sense means fairness: people should receive what they deserve. In addition, it is important to act consistently in cases that are similar in ethically relevant ways. Otherwise, decisions may be arbitrary, biased, and unfair. Justice forbids discrimination in health care based on race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or other personal characteristics (Chap. 16e). Justice also requires that limited health care resources be allocated fairly.

Just distribution has become a major issue in health care. The principles of justice apply only when the resource is desired or beneficial and to some extent scarce (51).

Motor neurons and interneurons constitute most of the multipolar neurons in the nervous system. \u0081 Bipolar neurons have one axon and one dendrite (see Fig. 12.2). Bipolar neurons are rare. They are most often associated with the receptors for the special senses (taste, smell, hearing, sight, and equilibrium). They are generally found within the retina of the eye and the ganglia of the vestibulocochlear nerve (cranial nerve VIII) of the ear. Some neurons in this group do", "ORs in humans requires a special coding system for different impulses. This is achieved by a population coding scheme, in which each OR protein binds to different odorants with different sensitivity. Thus, the olfactory system must decode olfactory impulses not from only one cell, but from the entire population of cells within the olfactory epithelium. Supporting cells provide mechanical and metabolic support for the olfactory receptor cells. Supporting cells are the most numerous cells in the olfactory epithelium. The nuclei of these tall columnar or sustentacular cells occupy a more apical position in the epithelium than do those of the other cell types, thus aiding in their identification in the light microscope (see Fig. 19.3 and Plate 69, page 688). They have numerous microvilli on their apical surface,", "for which Buck and Axel were awarded a Nobel Prize. This specificity for molecules is encoded neuroanatomically. Different odorant molecules activate specific olfactory receptors. Each olfactory neuron expresses only one allele of one receptor gene. Moreover, each olfactory glomerulus receives inputs from neurons expressing only one type of odorant receptor. In this way, each of the glomeruli is attuned to a distinct type of odorant stimulus. Presumably, this encoding is preserved in the olfactory cortex. Something is to be learned from a second, distinct olfactory system in many animals (the vomeronasal olfactory system or organ of Jacobson), in which the repertoire of olfactory receptors is much more limited than in their main olfactory system.

The visual system also has special significance in that study of this system has greatly advanced our knowledge of both the organization of all sensory neuronal systems and the relation of perception to cognition. Indeed, we know more about vision than about any other sensory function. Furthermore, the eyes, because of their diverse composition of epithelial, vascular, neural, and pigmentary tissues, are virtually a medical microcosm, susceptible to many diseases, and its tissues are available for inspection through a transparent medium. Impairment of visual function, expressed as defects in acuity and alterations of visual fields, obviously stands as the most important symptom of eye disease.

The olfactory nerve [I] carries special afferent (SA) fibers for the sense of smell. Its sensory neurons have: peripheral processes that act as receptors in the nasal mucosa, and central processes that return information to the brain. The receptors are in the roof and upper parts of the nasal cavity, and the central processes, after joining into small bundles, enter the cranial cavity by passing through the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone (Fig. 8.53). They terminate by synapsing with secondary neurons in the olfactory bulbs (Fig.", "3b and 1, whereas muscle and joint input (proprioceptive) dominates in areas 3a and 2.

The creatine phosphate store represents the immediate high-energy source for replenishing the ATP supply in skeletal muscle, especially during intense exercise.

The Nature of Primary Metabolic Myopathies The chemical energy for muscle contraction is provided by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP); ATP is restored by phosphocreatine and ADP acting in combination. These reactions are particularly important during brief, high-intensity exercise. During periods of prolonged muscle activity, rephosphorylation requires the availability of carbohydrates, fatty acids, and ketones, which are catabolized in mitochondria. Glycogen is the main sarcoplasmic source of carbohydrate, but blood glucose also moves freely in and out of muscle cells as needed during sustained exercise. The fatty acids in the blood, derived mainly from adipose tissue and intracellular lipid stores, constitute the other major source of energy.

Skeletal muscle fatigue during intense exercise is associated with depletion of the creatine phosphate store, although as described subsequently, this does not necessarily imply that the fatigue is caused by depletion of the creatine phosphate store.

This decay represents the rapid and almost total failure of the fast motor units. The decline in force/stress is paralleled by depletion of glycogen and creatine phosphate stores and the accumulation of lactic acid. Of importance is that the decline in force/ stress occurs when the ATP pool is not greatly reduced, so that the muscle fibers do not go into rigor. In contrast, the slow motor units are able to meet the energy demands of fibers under this condition, and they do not exhibit significant fatigue, even after many hours.

A regular program of isotonic exercise that is within the limits of the individual patient\u2019s threshold for the development of angina pectoris and that does not exceed 80% of the heart rate associated with ischemia on exercise testing should be strongly encouraged. Based on the results of an exercise test, the number of metabolic equivalent tasks (METs) performed at the onset of ischemia can be estimated (Table 293-2) and a practical exercise prescription can be formulated to permit daily activities that will fall below the ischemic threshold (Table 293-3).

[Note: CPT-I is also known as CAT-I for carnitine acyltransferase I.] This reaction forms an acylcarnitine and regenerates free CoA. Second, the acylcarnitine is transported into the mitochondrial matrix in exchange for free carnitine by carnitine\u2013acylcarnitine translocase. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT-II, or CAT-II), an enzyme of the inner mitochondrial membrane, catalyzes the transfer of the acyl group from carnitine to CoA in the mitochondrial matrix, thus regenerating free carnitine. b. Carnitine shuttle inhibitor: Malonyl CoA inhibits CPT-I, thus preventing the entry of long-chain acyl groups into the mitochondrial matrix. Therefore, when fatty acid synthesis is occurring in the cytosol (as indicated by the presence of malonyl CoA),", "inhibits CPT-I, thus preventing the entry of long-chain acyl groups into the mitochondrial matrix. Therefore, when fatty acid synthesis is occurring in the cytosol (as indicated by the presence of malonyl CoA), the newly made palmitate cannot be transferred into mitochondria and degraded. [Note: Muscle tissue, although it does not synthesize fatty acids, contains the mitochondrial isozyme of ACC (ACC2), allowing regulation of \u03b2oxidation. The liver contains both isozymes.] Fatty acid oxidation is also regulated by the acetyl CoA/CoA ratio: As the ratio increases, the CoA-requiring thiolase reaction decreases (Fig. 16.17). nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. c.

It can also be synthesized from the amino acids lysine and methionine by an enzymatic pathway", "of the pyruvate generated in glycolysis will be oxidatively decarboxylated to acetyl coenzyme A (CoA). However, the tricarboxylic acid cycle is inhibited by the rise in NADH, and the acetyl CoA is transported to the cytosol as citrate. The rise of acetyl CoA in the cytosol results in increased fatty acid (FA) synthesis. Recall that citrate is an allosteric activator of acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC). The malonyl product of ACC inhibits FA oxidation at the carnitine palmitoyltransferase I step. Because mitochondrial FA oxidation generates the acetyl CoA substrate for hepatic ketogenesis, ketone body levels do not rise. The FA gets esterified to the glycerol backbone, resulting in an increase in TAG that gets sent out of the liver as components of very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). [Note: The hypoglycemia results", "step in fatty acid synthesis is the transfer of acetate units from mitochondrial acetyl CoA to the cytosol. Mitochondrial acetyl CoA is produced by the oxidation of pyruvate (see p. 109) and by the catabolism of certain amino acids (see p. 266). However, the CoA portion of acetyl CoA cannot cross the inner mitochondrial membrane, and only the acetyl portion enters the cytosol. It does so as part of citrate produced by the condensation of acetyl CoA with oxaloacetate (OAA) by citrate synthase (Fig. 16.6). [Note: The transport of citrate to the cytosol occurs when the mitochondrial citrate concentration is high. This is observed when isocitrate dehydrogenase of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is inhibited by the presence of large amounts of ATP, causing citrate and isocitrate to", "glycerol-3-phosphate. The use of glycerol for fuel depends on the availability of tissue glycerokinase, which is abundant in the liver and kidneys.Free fatty acids absorbed by cells conjugate with acyl-CoA within the cytoplasm. The transport of fatty acyl-CoA from the outer mitochondrial membrane across the inner mito-chondrial membrane occurs via the carnitine shuttle (Fig. 2-21). Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), defined as those 6 to 12 carbons in length, bypass the carnitine shuttle and readily cross the mitochondrial membranes. This accounts in part for the fact that MCTs are more efficiently oxidized than LCTs. Ideally, the rapid oxidation of MCTs makes them less prone to fat deposition, particularly within immune cells and the reticu-loendothelial system\u2014a common finding with lipid infusion in parenteral nutrition.242 However, exclusive use of MCTs as fuel", "precursor. Fatty acid degradation (\u03b2-oxidation) occurs in mitochondria. The carnitine shuttle is required to transport long-chain fatty acids from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix. A translocase and the enzymes carnitine palmitoyltransferases (CPT) I and II are required. CPT-I is inhibited by malonyl CoA, thereby preventing simultaneous synthesis and degradation of fatty acids. Mitochondrial fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation produces acetyl CoA, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2). The first step in \u03b2-oxidation is catalyzed by one of four acyl CoA dehydrogenases, each with chain-length specificity. Medium-chain fatty acyl CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency causes a decrease in fatty acid oxidation (process stops once a medium-chain fatty acid is produced), resulting in hypoketonemia and severe hypoglycemia.

The oxidation of ethanol to acetate by dehydrogenases is accompanied by the reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to NADH. The rise in the NADH/NAD+ ratio shifts pyruvate to lactate and oxaloacetate (OAA) to malate, decreasing the availability of substrates for gluconeogenesis and resulting in hypoglycemia. The rise in NADH also reduces the NAD+ needed for fatty acid (FA) oxidation. The decrease in OAA shunts any acetyl coenzyme A produced to ketogenesis.

Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week\u2026 The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)\u2026Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F, or normal) to 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and then rapidly increasing to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F)\u2026  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance\u2026 Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors\u2026 The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise.

PART 2 Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseases Although most patients with elevated body temperature have fever, there are circumstances in which elevated temperature represents not fever but hyperthermia (heat stroke). Hyperthermia is characterized by an uncontrolled increase in body temperature that exceeds the body\u2019s ability to lose heat. The setting of the hypothalamic thermoregulatory center is unchanged. In contrast to fever in infections, hyperthermia does not involve pyrogenic molecules. Exogenous heat exposure and endogenous heat production are two mechanisms by which hyperthermia can result in dangerously high internal temperatures. Excessive heat production can easily cause hyperthermia despite physiologic and behavioral control of body temperature. For example, work or exercise in hot environments can produce heat faster than peripheral mechanisms can lose it.", "The immediate defense of thermoneutrality is via the autonomic nervous system, whereas delayed control is mediated by the endocrine system. Autonomic nervous system responses include the release of norepinephrine, increased muscle tone, and shivering, leading to thermogenesis and an increase in the basal metabolic rate. Cutaneous cold thermoreception causes direct reflex vasoconstriction to conserve heat. Prolonged exposure to cold also stimulates the thyroid axis, leading to an increased metabolic rate. In most cases of hypothermia, the history of exposure to environmental factors (e.g., prolonged exposure to the outdoors without adequate clothing) makes the diagnosis straightforward. In urban settings, however, the presentation is often more subtle, and other disease processes, toxin exposures, or psychiatric diagnoses should be considered. After initial stimulation by hypothermia, there is progressive depression of all", "period of collapse, which is usually brief, equilibrium is spontaneously reestablished if the victim is able to rehydrate. Heat stroke is associated with high ambient temperatures and high humidity. Thermoregulatory mechanisms fail, sweating ceases, and core body temperature rises. In the clinical setting, a rectal temperature of 106\u00b0F or higher is considered a grave prognostic sign, and the mortality rate for such patients exceeds 50%. The underlying mechanism is marked generalized peripheral vasodilation with peripheral pooling of blood and a decreased effective circulating blood volume. Necrosis of the muscles and myocardium may occur. Arrhythmias, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and other systemic effects are common. Elderly people, persons with cardiovascular disease, and otherwise healthy people undergoing physical stress (such as young athletes and military recruits) are prime candidates for heat", "coagulation, and other systemic effects are common. Elderly people, persons with cardiovascular disease, and otherwise healthy people undergoing physical stress (such as young athletes and military recruits) are prime candidates for heat stroke. \u2022 Malignant hyperthermia, although similar sounding, is not caused by exposure to high temperatures. It is a genetic condition resulting from mutations in genes such as RYR1 that control calcium levels in skeletal muscle cells. In affected individuals, exposure to certain anesthetics during surgery may trigger a rapid rise in calcium levels in skeletal muscle, which in turn leads to muscle rigidity and increased heat production. The resulting hyperthermia has a mortality rate of approximately 80% if untreated, but this falls to less than 5% if the condition is recognized and muscle relaxants are administered", "ejection of blood by the left ventricle and diminished peripheral runoff during the brief ventricular ejection period (see also During exhaustive exercise, the compensatory mechanisms begin to fail. The heart rate attains a maximal level of approximately 180 beats per minute, and stroke volume reaches a plateau. The heart rate may then decrease, which results in a fall in blood pressure. The exercising individual also frequently becomes dehydrated. Sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity supersedes the vasodilator influence on vessels of the skin so that the rate of heat loss is decreased. Body temperature is normally elevated during exercise. A reduction in heat loss through cutaneous vasoconstriction can lead to very high body temperatures and to acute distress during severe exercise.

Lack of sweating after a hot bath, during exercise, or on a hot day can suggest sudomotor failure. OH (also called orthostatic or postural hypotension) is perhaps the most disabling feature of autonomic dysfunction. The prevalence of OH is relatively high, especially when OH associated with aging and diabetes mellitus is included (Table 454-4). OH can cause a variety of symptoms, including dimming or loss of vision, lightheadedness, diaphoresis, diminished hearing, pallor, and weakness. Syncope results when the drop in BP impairs cerebral perfusion. Other manifestations of impaired baroreflexes are supine hypertension, a heart rate that is fixed regardless of posture, postprandial hypotension, and an excessively high nocturnal BP. Many patients with OH have a", "cold pressor test. In normal persons, immersing one hand in ice water for 1 to 5 min raises the systolic pressure by 15 to 20 mm Hg and the diastolic pressure by 10 to 15 mm Hg. Similarly, the sustained isometric contraction of a group of muscles (e.g., those of the forearm in handgrip) for 5 min normally increases the heart rate and the systolic and diastolic pressures by at least 15 mm Hg.

In acute myocardial infarction associated with low cardiac output, hypothermia may be reversed after adequate resuscitation. With extensive burns, psoriasis, erythrodermas, and other skin diseases, increased peripheral-blood flow leads to excessive heat loss. Heat loss occurs through five mechanisms: radiation (55\u201365% of heat loss), conduction (10\u201315% of heat loss, much increased in cold water), convection (increased in the wind), respiration, and evaporation; both of the latter two mechanisms are affected by the ambient temperature and the relative humidity.

As indicated, the receptor is postulated to exist in the inactive, nonfunctional form (Ri) and in the activated form (Ra). Thermodynamic considerations indicate that even in the absence of any agonist, some of the receptor pool must exist in the Ra form some of the time and may produce the same physiologic effect as agonist-induced activity.

Indirect-acting agents produce their primary effects by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, which hydrolyzes acetylcholine to choline and acetic acid (see Figure 6\u20133). By inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, the indirect-acting drugs increase the endogenous acetylcholine concentration in synaptic clefts and neuroeffector junctions. The excess acetylcholine, in turn, stimulates cholinoceptors to evoke increased responses. These drugs act primarily where acetylcholine is physiologically released and are thus amplifiers of endogenous acetylcholine. Some cholinesterase inhibitors also inhibit butyrylcholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase). However, inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase plays little role in the action of indirect-acting cholinomimetic drugs because this enzyme is not important in the physiologic termination of synaptic acetylcholine action.

In excessive doses, pralidoxime can induce neuromuscular weakness and other adverse effects. Pralidoxime is not recommended for the reversal of inhibition of acetylcholinesterase by carbamate inhibitors. Further details of treatment of anticholinesterase toxicity are given in Chapter 58.

This prophylaxis can be achieved with pyridostigmine but is reserved for situations in which", "atropine. Protection is provided by pyridostigmine, which, by prior binding to the enzyme, impedes binding of organophosphate agents and thereby prevents prolonged inhibition of cholinesterase. The protection is limited to the peripheral nervous system because pyridostigmine does not readily enter the central nervous system. Enzyme inhibition by pyridostigmine dissipates within hours (Table 7\u20134), a duration of time that allows clearance of the organophosphate agent from the body. Chronic exposure to certain organophosphate compounds, including some organophosphate cholinesterase inhibitors, causes delayed neuropathy associated with demyelination of axons.

Special sequences in the DNA serve as punctuation, defining where the information for each protein begins and ends.

When a stop codon is encountered, the ribosome releases the finished protein, and its two subunits separate again. These subunits can then be used to start the synthesis of another protein on another mRNA molecule. Ribosomes operate with remarkable efficiency: in one second, a eukaryotic ribosome adds 2 amino acids to a polypeptide chain; the ribosomes of bacterial cells operate even faster, at a rate of about 20 amino acids per second. To choreograph the many coordinated movements required for efficient translation, a ribosome contains four binding sites for RNA molecules: one is for the mRNA and three", "amounts of genetic information required by such cells.

Before the synthesis of a particular protein can begin, the corresponding mRNA molecule must be produced by transcription. Bacteria contain a single type of RNA polymerase (the enzyme that carries out the transcription of DNA into RNA). An mRNA molecule is produced after this enzyme initiates transcription at a promoter, synthesizes the RNA by chain elongation, stops transcription at a terminator, and releases both the DNA template and the completed mRNA molecule. In eukaryotic cells, the process of transcription is much more complex, and there are three RNA polymerases\u2014polymerase I, II, and III\u2014that are related evolutionarily to one another and to the bacterial polymerase.

This initiator tRNA always carries the amino acid methionine (in bacteria, a modified form of methionine\u2014formylmethionine\u2014is used), with the result that all newly made proteins have methionine as the first amino acid at their N-terminus, the end of a protein that is synthesized first.

Therefore, a discussion of gene regulation with a look at the simpler prokary-otic system precedes that of the more complex transcription and posttranscriptional regulation of eukaryotic genes.Transcription in Bacteria Initiation of transcription in pro-karyotes begins with the recognition of DNA sequences by RNA polymerase.

The A site binds an incoming aminoacyl-tRNA, the P site is occupied by peptidyl-tRNA, and the E site is occupied by the empty tRNA as it is about to exit the ribosome. Recognition of an mRNA codon is accomplished by the tRNA anticodon, which binds to the codon following the rules of complementarity and antiparallel binding.

For example, estriol is often promoted as a hormone that does everything that conjugated equine estrogen does but with none of the risks. Given that it is a significantly weaker estrogen than conjugated equine estrogen, this is dubious and is not based in scientific evidence. 2.

Basal Levels of 17\u03b1-Hydroxyprogesterone Basal levels of 17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone higher than 800 ng/dL are virtually diagnostic of CAH. Levels between 300 and 800 ng/dL require stimulatory testing with corticotropin to distinguish between PCOS and CAH. To complicate the situation even further, nonclassic 21-hydroxylase deficiency may occur even when basal levels of 17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone are below 300 ng/dL, thus requiring stimulatory testing in those cases. Cosyntropin Stimulation Test The most commonly used stimulatory test involves measurement of 17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone 30 minutes after administration of a bolus of 0.25 mg of synthetic cosyntropin (Cortrosyn) (96).

Acids are characterized as being strong or weak, depending on how readily they give up their protons to water. Strong acids, such as hydrochloric acid (HCl), lose their protons quickly. Acetic acid, on the other hand, is a weak acid because it holds on to its proton more tightly when dissolved in water.

OVERVIEW Obesity is a disorder of body weight regulatory systems characterized by an accumulation of excess body fat. In primitive societies, in which daily life required a high level of physical activity and food was only available intermittently, a genetic tendency favoring storage of excess calories as fat may have had a survival value. Today, however, the sedentary lifestyle and abundance and wide variety of palatable, inexpensive foods in industrialized societies has undoubtedly contributed to an obesity epidemic. As adiposity has", "Board considers to be healthful. These ranges are 10\u201335% of calories for protein, 20\u201335% of calories for fat, and 45\u201365% of calories for carbohydrate. Alcohol, which also provides energy, is not a nutrient; therefore, no recommendations are not provided. The DRIs are affected by age, sex, rate of growth, pregnancy, lactation, physical activity level, concomitant diseases, drugs, and dietary composition. If requirements for nutrient sufficiency are close to levels indicating excess of a nutrient, dietary planning is difficult. Physiologic Factors Growth, strenuous physical activity, pregnancy, and lactation all increase needs for energy and several essential nutrients. Energy needs rise during pregnancy due to the demands of fetal growth and during lactation because of the increased energy required for milk production. Energy needs decrease with loss of lean body", "3 fatty acids per week; decreasing sodium intake to <2300 mg/d; consuming 3 cups of milk (or equivalent low-fat or fat-free dairy products) per day; limiting cholesterol intake to <300 mg/d; and keeping total fat intake at 20\u201335% of daily calories and saturated fat intake at <10% of daily calories. Application of these guidelines to specific calorie goals can be found on the website www.choosemyplate.gov. The revised Dietary Reference Intakes for Macronutrients released by the Institute of Medicine recommends that 45\u201365% of calories come from carbohydrates, 20\u201335% from fat, and 10\u201335% from protein.

The Web version of the guide provides a calculator that tailors the number of servings suggested for healthy patients of different weights, sexes, ages, and life-cycle stages to help them to meet their needs while avoiding excess (http://www.supertracker.usda.gov/default.aspx and www .ChooseMyPlate.gov).

Experienced neurologists recognize that certain leading neurologic features are indicative of particular degenerative dementias. Foremost among these are disorders of movement, for example, prominent and early parkinsonian signs such as bradykinesia, tremor, and shortened step are characteristic of the subcortical dementias of Lewy body and Parkinson", "this enzyme. Whether dopamine functions in an excitatory or inhibitory manner at a particular synapse is determined by the local receptor. As mentioned earlier, excitatory D1 receptors predominate on the small spiny putaminal neurons that are the origin of the direct striatopallidal output pathway, whereas D2 receptors mediate the inhibitory influence of dopamine on the indirect striatopallidal output, as indicated in Fig. 4-4. Some of the clinical and pharmacologic effects of dopamine are made clear by considering both the anatomic sites of various receptors and their physiologic effects. For example, it appears that drug-induced parkinsonian syndromes and tardive dyskinesias (described further on) are prone to occur when drugs are administered that competitively bind to the D2 receptor, but that the newer antipsychosis drugs, which produce fewer of these", "ones, such as control of arterial pressure. The diffuse nature of the projection pattern of most of the amine systems is mirrored in their proposed functions. Activity in the different aminergic systems is believed to be important in setting global brain states. For example, these systems are involved in setting the level of arousal (sleep, waking), attention, and mood. Their involvement in pathways connected with the hypothalamus and other autonomic centers also indicates that they have important homeostatic functions. The role of dopamine in balancing the flow of activity through the basal ganglia pathways and how its loss leads to the motor symptoms observed in Parkinson\u2019s disease are described in ATP has the potential to act as a transmitter or cotransmitter at synapses in the peripheral and central", "behavior. Finally, perhaps the most convincing line of evidence supporting the monoamine hypothesis is the fact that (at the time of this writing) all available antidepressants appear to have significant effects on the monoamine system. All classes of antidepressants appear to enhance the synaptic availability of 5-HT, norepinephrine, or dopamine. Attempts to develop antidepressants that work on other neurotransmitter systems have not been effective to date. The monoamine hypothesis, like the neurotrophic hypothesis, is at best incomplete. Many studies have not found an alteration in function or levels of monoamines in depressed patients. In addition, some candidate antidepressant agents under study do not act directly on the monoamine system. In addition to the monoamines, the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate appears to be important in the pathophysiology of depression. A", "and similar cortical loops are now thought to also play an important role in regulating normal behavioral, emotional, and cognitive functions. In PD, dopamine denervation with loss of dopaminergic tone leads to increased firing of neurons in the STN and GPi, excessive inhibition of the thalamus, reduced activation of cortical motor systems, and the development of parkinsonian features (Fig. 449-5). The current role of surgery in the treatment of PD is based on this model, which predicted that lesions or high-frequency stimulation of the STN or GPi might reduce this neuronal overactivity and improve PD features. Since its introduction in the late 1960s, levodopa has been the mainstay of therapy for PD.

Impedance matching in the ear depends on (1) the ratio of the surface area of the large tympanic membrane advantage of the lever system formed by the ossicles. This impedance matching is sufficient to increase the efficiency of energy transfer by nearly 30 dB in the range of hearing from 300 to 3500 Hz. The middle ear also serves other functions. Two muscles are found in the middle ear: the tensor tympani attached to the malleus and the stapedius attached to the stapes. When these muscles contract, they damp movements of the ossicles and decrease the sensitivity of the acoustic apparatus. This action can protect the acoustic apparatus against damaging sounds that can be", "of tuning forks of different frequencies but most accurately by the use of an audiometer and the construction of an audiogram, which reveals the entire range of hearing at a glance.

Despite the universality of the central dogma of molecular biology, there are important variations between organisms in the way in which information flows from DNA to protein.

CHAPTER SUMMARY Enzymes are protein catalysts that increase the velocity of a chemical reaction by lowering the energy of the transition state (Fig. 5.23). They are not consumed during the reaction. Enzyme molecules contain a special cleft called the active site, which contains amino acid side chains that participate in substrate binding and catalysis. The active site binds the substrate, forming an enzyme\u2013substrate (ES) complex. Binding is thought to cause a conformational change in the enzyme (induced fit) that allows catalysis. ES is converted to enzyme and product. An enzyme allows a reaction to proceed rapidly under conditions prevailing in the cell by providing an alternate reaction pathway with a lower activation energy (Ea). Because the", "Study enzymes STEADY-STATE ENZYME KINETICS Many enzymes have only one substrate, which they bind and then process to produce products according to the scheme outlined in Figure 3\u201350A.

In this case, EP need not be represented, and we can express the rate of the reaction\u2014known as its velocity, V, as where [ES] is the concentration of the enzyme\u2013substrate complex, and kcat is the turnover number, a rate constant that has a value equal to the number of substrate molecules processed per enzyme molecule each second.

Thus no matter how much an enzyme speeds up a reaction, it cannot change its direction. Despite the above limitation, enzymes steer all of the reactions in cells through specific reaction paths. This is because enzymes are both highly selective and very precise, usually catalyzing only one particular reaction. In other words, each enzyme selectively lowers the activation energy of only one of the several possible chemical reactions that its bound substrate molecules could undergo. In this way, sets of enzymes can direct each of the many different molecules in a cell along a particular reaction pathway (Figure 2\u201324).

For example, in a Canadian study, 3407 women were randomly assigned at 41 or more weeks to induction or to fetal testing (Hannah, 1992). In the surveillance group, evaluation included: (1) counting fetal movements during a 2-hour period each day, (2) nons tress testing three times weekly, and (3) amnionic fluid volume assessment two to three times weekly, with pockets <3 em considered abnormal.

The nucleotide sequence of any genome can be determined rapidly and simply by using highly automated techniques based on several different strategies. Comparison of the genome sequences of different organisms allows us to trace the evolutionary relationships among genes and organisms, and it has proved valuable for discovering new genes and predicting their functions. Taken together, these techniques for analyzing and manipulating DNA have made it possible to sequence, identify, and isolate genes from any organism of interest. Related technologies allow scientists to produce the protein products of these genes in the large quantities needed for detailed analyses of their structure and function, as well as for medical purposes. Ultimately, one wishes to determine how genes\u2014and the proteins they encode\u2014 function in the intact", "genome other than a specific DNA sequence has the central role in attracting ORC and specifying mammalian origins of replication. These ideas could also help to explain how a given mammalian cell chooses which of the many possible origins to use when it replicates its genome and how this choice could differ from cell to cell. Clearly, we have a great deal to discover about the fundamental process of DNA replication initiation. New Nucleosomes Are Assembled Behind the Replication Fork Several additional aspects of DNA replication are specific to eukaryotes. As discussed in Chapter 4, eukaryotic chromosomes are composed of roughly equal mixtures of DNA and protein. Chromosome duplication therefore requires not only the replication of DNA, but also the synthesis and assembly of new chromosomal proteins onto", "type will tend to be perpetuated, because the altered cell has an increased likelihood of reproducing itself. Changes due to mistakes of the second type\u2014selectively neutral changes\u2014may be perpetuated or not: in the competition for limited resources, it is a matter of chance whether the altered cell or its cousins will succeed. But changes that cause serious damage lead nowhere: the cell that suffers them dies, leaving no progeny. Through endless repetition of this cycle of error and trial\u2014of mutation and natural selection\u2014organisms evolve: their genetic specifications change, giving them new ways to exploit the environment more effectively, to survive in competition with others, and to reproduce successfully. Some parts of the genome will change more easily than others in the course of evolution. A segment of DNA", "as a DNA library.

An alternative strategy, one that enriches for protein-coding genes, is to begin the cloning process by selecting only those DNA sequences that are transcribed into mRNA and thus correspond to protein-encoding genes. This is done by extracting the mRNA from cells and then making a DNA copy of each mRNA Figure 8\u201330 Human genomic libraries containing DNA fragments that represent the whole human genome can be constructed using restriction nucleases and DNA ligase. Such a genomic library consists of a set of bacteria,", "eukaryotes, such as yeast, have concise genomes, consisting of little more than strings of closely packed genes. However, the genomes of multicellular plants and animals, as well as many other eukaryotes, contain, in addition to genes, a large quantity of interspersed DNA whose function is poorly understood (Figure 4\u201313). Some of this additional DNA is crucial for the proper control of gene expression, and this may in part explain why there is so much of it in multicellular organisms, whose genes have to be switched on and off according to complicated rules during development (discussed in Chapters 7 and 21). Differences in the amount of DNA interspersed between genes, far more than differences in numbers of genes, account for the astonishing variations in genome size that we see", "begins and ends. One very important approach to deciphering our genome is to search for DNA sequences that are closely similar between different species, on the principle that DNA sequences that have a function are much more likely to be conserved than those without a function. For example, humans and mice are thought to have diverged from a common mammalian ancestor about 80 \u00d7 106 years ago, which is long enough for the majority of nucleotides in their genomes to have been changed by random mutational events. Consequently, the only regions that will have remained closely similar in the two genomes are those in which mutations would have impaired function and put the animals carrying them at a disadvantage, resulting in their elimination from the population by natural", "sequence of the 3.2 billion nucleotide pairs in the human genome is the fact that much of it is probably functionally unimportant. The regions of the genome that code for the amino acid sequences of proteins (the exons) are typically found in short segments (average size about 145 nucleotide pairs), small islands in a sea of DNA whose exact nucleotide sequence is thought to be mostly of little consequence. This arrangement makes it difficult to identify all the exons in a stretch of DNA, and it is often hard too to determine exactly where a gene begins and ends. One very important approach to deciphering our genome is to search for DNA sequences that are closely similar between different species, on the principle that DNA sequences that have", "DNA also contains many genes specifying proteins required in chloroplasts. In both cases, the DNA sequences of these nuclear genes show clear evidence of their origin from the bacterial ancestor of the respective organelle. Natural selection has evidently favored mitochondria with small genomes. By contrast, the nuclear genomes of most eukaryotes seem to have been free to enlarge. Perhaps the eukaryotic way of life has made large size an advantage: predators typically need to be bigger than their prey, and cell size generally increases in proportion to genome size. Whatever the reason, aided by a massive accumulation of DNA segments derived from parasitic transposable elements (discussed in Chapter 5), the genomes of most eukaryotes have become orders of magnitude larger than those of bacteria and archaea (Figure 1\u201332).", "gene can in theory be accomplished through the introduction of a stop codon anywhere in the coding sequence, whereas activations require precise substitutions at residues that can somehow lead to an increase in the activity of the encoded protein. Importantly, the specificity of oncogene mutations provides diagnostic opportunities, as tests that identify mutations at defined positions are easier to design than tests aimed at detecting random changes in a gene. The second mechanism for activation of oncogenes is DNA sequence amplification, leading to overexpression of the gene product. This increase in DNA copy number may cause cytologically recognizable chromosome alterations referred to as homogeneous staining regions (HSRs) if integrated within chromosomes, or double minutes (dmins) if extrachromosomal.

Steroidogenic cells have some capacity for cholesterol synthesis but often obtain cholesterol from cholesterol-rich lipoproteins (low-density lipoproteins and high-density lipoproteins). Pregnenolone is then further modified by several enzymatic reactions. Because of their hydrophobic nature, steroid hormones and precursors can leave the steroidogenic cell easily and thus are not stored. Therefore, steroidogenesis is regulated at the level of uptake, storage, and mobilization of cholesterol and at the level of steroidogenic enzyme gene expression and activity.

Alterations in the composition of the plasma lipids caused by estrogens are characterized by an increase in the high-density lipoproteins (HDL), a slight reduction in the low-density lipoproteins (LDL), and a reduction in total plasma cholesterol levels. Plasma triglyceride levels are increased. Estrogens decrease hepatic oxidation of adipose tissue lipid to ketones and increase synthesis of triglycerides. E. Effects on Blood Coagulation Estrogens enhance the coagulability of blood. Many changes in factors influencing coagulation have been reported, including increased circulating levels of factors II, VII, IX, and X and decreased antithrombin III, partially as a result of the hepatic effects mentioned above.

In some studies, the decrease in HDL and increase in LDL are statistically significant, although the values remain within normal ranges (233). DMPA is not associated with myocardial infarction.

After metabolic enzymatic degradation in the peripheral tissues, IDL remains and is either catabolized in the liver by binding to LDL receptors or modified in the peripheral tissues. As noted previously, they are associated with apoprotein E receptors, the liver recognition receptors. The LDL cholesterol, or the so-called high-risk cholesterol, is found in high circulating levels. Despite the negative connotation of LDL in cardiovascular disease, it is a very important cellular metabolite and precursor for adrenocortical cells, lymphocytes, and renal cells.

Two general processes contribute to maintenance of blood glucose during the fasting phase: hepatic glucose production and glucose sparing. Hepatic glucose production is in turn based on two metabolic pathways. The first is the rapid catabolic process", "accept exported cholesterol can vary widely at identical levels of HDL-C. The ability of peripheral tissues to export cholesterol via the transporter mechanism and the acceptor capacity of HDL are emerging as major determinants of coronary atherosclerosis. Lipoprotein disorders are detected by measuring lipids in serum after a 10-hour fast. Risk of heart disease increases with concentrations of the atherogenic lipoproteins, is inversely related to levels of HDL-C, and is modified by other risk factors. Evidence from clinical trials suggests that an LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) level of 50-60 mg/dL is optimal for patients with coronary disease. Ideally, triglycerides should be below 120 mg/dL. Although LDL-C is still the primary target of treatment, reducing the levels of VLDL and IDL also is important. Calculation of non-HDL cholesterol provides a", "atresia.

The placental uptake and use ofLDL is an alternative mechanism for fetal assimilation of essential fatty acids and amino acids (Chap. 5, p. 103). LDL binds to specific receptors in the coated-pit regions of the syncytiotrophoblast microvilli. The large LDL particle, measuring about 250,000 Da, is taken up by a process of receptor-mediated endocytosis. The apoprotein and cholesterol esters of LD L are hydrolyzed by lysosomal enzymes in the syncytium to yield: (1) cholesterol for progesterone synthesis; (2) free amino acids, including essential amino acids; and (3) essential fatty acids, primarily linoleic acid. he placenta concentrates many amino acids in the syncytiotrophoblast, which are then transferred to the fetal side by difusion.

FACTORS AFFECTING REACTION VELOCITY Enzymes can be isolated from cells and their properties studied in a test tube (that is, in vitro). Different enzymes show different responses to changes in substrate concentration, temperature, and pH. This section describes factors that influence the reaction velocity of enzymes. Enzymic responses to these factors give us valuable clues as to how enzymes function in living cells (that is, in vivo). A. Substrate concentration 1. Maximal velocity: The rate or velocity of a reaction (v) is the number of substrate molecules converted to product per unit", "number of substrate molecules having sufficient energy to pass over the energy barrier and form the products of the reaction. 2. Velocity decrease with higher temperature: Further elevation of the temperature causes a decrease in reaction velocity as a result of temperature-induced denaturation of the enzyme (see Fig. 5.7). The optimum temperature for most human enzymes is between 35\u00b0C and 40\u00b0C. Human enzymes start to denature (see p. 20) at temperatures above 40\u00b0C, but thermophilic bacteria found in hot springs have optimum temperatures of 70\u00b0C. C. pH 1. pH effect on active site ionization: The concentration of protons ([H+]) affects reaction velocity in several ways. First, the catalytic process usually requires that the enzyme and substrate have specific chemical groups in either an ionized or unionized state in", "known: some are capable of speeding up reactions by factors of 1014 or more. Enzymes thereby allow reactions that would not otherwise occur to proceed rapidly at normal temperatures. An enzyme cannot change the equilibrium point for a reaction. The reason is simple: when an enzyme (or any catalyst) lowers the activation energy for the reaction Y \u2192 X, of necessity it also lowers the activation energy for the reaction X \u2192 Y by exactly the same amount (see Figure 2\u201321). The forward and backward reactions will therefore be accelerated by the same factor by an enzyme, and the equilibrium point for the reaction will be unchanged (Figure 2\u201323). Thus no matter how much an enzyme speeds up a reaction, it cannot change its direction. Despite the above", "of protons ([H+]) affects reaction velocity in several ways. First, the catalytic process usually requires that the enzyme and substrate have specific chemical groups in either an ionized or unionized state in order to interact. For example, catalytic activity may require that an amino group of the enzyme be in the protonated form (\u2212NH3+). Because this group is deprotonated at alkaline pH, the rate of the reaction declines. 2. pH effect on enzyme denaturation: Extremes of pH can also lead to denaturation of the enzyme, because the structure of the catalytically active protein molecule depends on the ionic character of the amino acid side chains. 3. Variable pH optimum: The pH at which maximal enzyme activity is achieved is different for different enzymes and often reflects the [H+]", "the ionic character of the amino acid side chains. 3. Variable pH optimum: The pH at which maximal enzyme activity is achieved is different for different enzymes and often reflects the [H+] at which the enzyme functions in the body. For example, pepsin, a digestive enzyme in the stomach, is maximally active at pH 2, whereas other enzymes, designed to work at neutral pH, are denatured by such an acidic environment (Fig. 5.8). VI. MICHAELIS-MENTEN KINETICS Leonor Michaelis and Maude Menten proposed a simple model that accounts for most of the features of many enzyme-catalyzed reactions. In this model, the enzyme reversibly combines with its substrate to form an ES complex that subsequently yields product, regenerating the free enzyme.

CHAPTER SUMMARY Enzymes are protein catalysts that increase the velocity of a chemical reaction by lowering the energy of the transition state (Fig. 5.23). They are not consumed during the reaction. Enzyme molecules contain a special cleft called the active site, which contains amino acid side chains that participate in substrate binding and catalysis. The active site binds the substrate, forming an enzyme\u2013substrate (ES) complex. Binding is thought to cause a conformational change in the enzyme (induced fit) that allows catalysis. ES is converted to enzyme and product. An enzyme allows a reaction to proceed rapidly under conditions prevailing in the cell by providing an alternate reaction pathway with a lower activation energy (Ea). Because the", "out by simply cycling the temperatures within the reaction tube. The specificity and yield in amplifying a particular DNA frag-ment by PCR reaction are affected by the proper setting of the reaction parameters (e.g., enzyme, primer, and Mg2+ concen-tration, as well as the temperature cycling profile). Modifying various PCR parameters to optimize the specificity of amplifi-cation yields more homogenous products, even in rare template reactions.The emergence of the PCR technique has dramatically altered the approach to both fundamental and applied bio-logic problems. The capability of amplifying a specific DNA fragment from a gene or the whole genome greatly advances the study of the gene and its function.

One of these pumps may have used the energy available from ATP hydrolysis to eject H+ from the cell; such a proton pump could have been the ancestor of present-day ATP synthases. As the Earth\u2019s supply of geochemically produced nutrients began to dwindle, organisms that could find a way to pump H+ without consuming ATP would have been at an advantage: they could save the small amounts of ATP they derived from the fermentation of increasingly scarce foodstuffs to fuel other important activities.

Many microbial species have branched fermentation pathways that allow them to dispose of reducing equivalents (e.g., by the production of H2, which is energetically efficient).

Diffusion is the process by which molecules move spontaneously from an area of high concentration to one of low concentration.

To benefit from this barrier, however, cells have had to evolve ways of transferring specific water-soluble molecules and ions across their membranes in order to ingest essential nutrients, excrete metabolic waste products, and regulate intracellular ion concentrations. Cells use specialized membrane transport proteins to accomplish this goal. The importance of such small molecule transport is reflected in the large number of genes in all organisms that code for the transmembrane transport proteins involved, which make up 15\u201330% of the membrane proteins in all cells.

Transporter ATPases include the notorious multidrug resistance (MDR) protein, which pumps polar compounds (e.g., chemotherapeutic drugs) out of cells and may render cancer cells resistant to treatment.

We begin this chapter by describing some general principles of how small water-soluble molecules traverse cell membranes.

According to the second law of thermodynamics the universe tends toward maximum disorder (largest entropy or greatest probability). Thus, a chemical reaction can proceed spontaneously only if it results in a net increase in the disorder of the universe (see Figure 2\u201316). This disorder of the universe can be expressed most conveniently in terms of the free energy of a system, a concept we touched on earlier. Free energy, G, is an expression of the energy available to do work\u2014for example, the work of driving chemical reactions. The value of G is of interest only when a system undergoes a change, denoted \u2206G (delta G). The change in G is critical because, as explained in Panel 2\u20137 (pp. 102\u2013103), \u2206G is a direct measure", "a coupled reaction is illustrated by a mechanical analogy in Figure 2\u201332, in which an energetically favorable chemical reaction is represented by rocks falling from a cliff.

By careful design, however, part of this energy could be used instead to drive a paddle wheel that lifts a bucket of water (Figure 2\u201332B).

The reason for this reorientation is that there is only a single way in which the original orderly state of the coins can be reinstated (every coin must lie heads up), whereas there are many different ways (about 10298) to achieve a disorderly state in which there is an equal mixture of heads and tails; in fact, there are more ways to achieve a 50-50 state than to achieve", "such profound implications for life that we will restate it in several ways.

An elevated AaDO2 during a properly conducted study with 100% O2 signifies the presence of a shunt (anatomical or physiological); the magnitude of the AaDO2 can be used to quantify the proportion of the cardiac output that is being shunted. The regional differences in ventilation and perfusion and the relationship between ventilation and perfusion were discussed earlier in this chapter.

An anatomical shunt occurs when mixed venous blood bypasses the gas-exchange unit and goes directly into the arterial circulation ( Fig. 23.9 ). Alveolar ventilation, the distribution of alveolar gas, and the composition of alveolar gas are normal, but the distribution of cardiac output is changed. Some of the cardiac output goes through the pulmonary capillary bed that supplies the gas-exchange units, but the rest of it bypasses the gas-exchange units and goes directly into the arterial circulation. The blood that bypasses the gas-exchange unit is thus shunted, and because the blood is deoxygenated, this type of bypass is called a right-to-left shunt. Most anatomical shunts develop within the heart,", "another important determinant of cardiac work because the cardiac output equals stroke volume times theheart rate. Additional factors also affect cardiac performance(Table 145-1). Heart failure occurs when the heart is unable to pump blood at a rate commensurate with metabolic needs (oxygen delivery). It may be due to a change in myocardial contractility that results in low cardiac output or to abnormal loading conditions being placed on the myocardium. The abnormal loading conditions may be afterload (pressure overload, such as with aortic stenosis, pulmonary stenosis, or coarctation of the aorta) or preload (volume overload, such as in ventricular septal defect (VSD), patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), or valvular insufficiency.

In this sense, expertise involves a working knowledge of the diagnostic possibilities and what features distinguish one disease from another. Memorization alone is insufficient.

Ionizing radiation refers to waves or particles-photons-of signiicant energy that can change the structure of molecules such as those in DNA or that can create free radical or ions capable of secondarily damaging tissue (Hall, 1991; National Research Council, 1990).

This ultrasound technique using different sound frequencies and intensities, has also become a principal methodology for clinical study of the fetal and neonatal brain.

Although M-mode echocardiography has largely been supplanted by two-dimensional echocardiography, it is still used because of its high temporal resolution and accuracy for making linear measurements.

Just as the energy stored in the raised bucket of water in Figure 2\u201332B can drive a wide variety of hydraulic machines, ATP is a convenient and versatile store, or currency, of energy used to drive a variety of chemical reactions in cells. ATP is synthesized in an energetically unfavorable phosphorylation reaction in which a phosphate group is added to ADP (adenosine diphosphate). When required, ATP gives up its energy packet through its energetically favorable hydrolysis to ADP and inorganic phosphate (Figure 2\u201333). The regenerated ADP is then available to", "on earth where the first of reactions that act in series, the products of each being the starting material for the cells originated? for example, what next: glycolysis (which occurs in the cytosol), the citric acid cycle (in the mitochon-might we conclude from the universally shared high K+/na+ ratio, neutral ph, drial matrix), and oxidative phosphorylation (on the inner mitochondrial mem and central role of phosphates? brane). The intermediate products of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle are used both as sources of metabolic energy and to produce many of the small molecules used as the raw materials for biosynthesis.

In this way, one can predict the direction of a reaction and thereby readily check the feasibility of any proposed mechanism. Thus, for example, from the observed values for the magnitude of the electrochemical proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane and the \u02dcG for ATP hydrolysis inside the mitochondrion, one can be certain that ATP synthase requires the passage of more than one proton for each molecule of ATP that it synthesizes. The value of \u02dcG for a reaction is a direct measure of how far the reaction is from equilibrium. The large negative value for ATP hydrolysis in a cell merely refects", "in cells, ATP is the principle energy currency. To give just two examples, it supplies energy for many of the pumps that transport substances into and out of the cell (discussed in Chapter 11), and it powers the molecular motors that enable muscle cells to contract and nerve cells to transport materials from one end of their long axons to another (discussed in Chapter 16). energy stored in aTp is often harnessed to Join Two molecules Together We have previously discussed one way in which an energetically favorable reaction can be coupled to an energetically unfavorable reaction, X \u2192 Y, so as to enable it to occur.

This is the result of the activity of the Na+,K+-ATPase, which transports 3 Na+ ions out of the cell and 2 K+ ions into the cell for each ATP molecule hydrolyzed.

Cells with no or very few mitochondria (e.g., erythrocytes, lens cells of the eye) are absolutely dependent on glucose for energy. Additionally the brain can only use glucose under normal conditions, in that it has essentially no capacity for oxidation of FFAs and only marginal capacity for the use of lactate, ketone bodies (KBs), and AAs as fuels. Thus in all metabolic phases, maintenance of blood glucose above a certain minimal threshold is absolutely necessary to avoid central nervous system (CNS)-related symptoms, beginning with those caused by a hypoglycemia-activated autonomic response (e.g.,"]}, {"id": "seed_task_9999", "name": "MMLU_test_collegemedicine", "is_classification": true, "instruction": "In this task, you are given a question and four different answer options.

This process often requires one to several weeks of exposure and work in a hot environment. During acclimatization, the thermoregulatory set point is altered, and this alteration affects the onset, volume, and content of diaphoresis. The threshold for the initiation of sweating is lowered, and the amount of sweat increases, with a lowered salt concentration. Sweating rates can be 1\u20132 L/h in acclimated individuals during heat stress. Plasma volume expansion also occurs and improves cutaneous vascular flow.

Sensible water losses such as sweating or pathologic loss of gastrointestinal (GI) fluids vary widely, but these include the loss of electrolytes as well as water (Table 3-1). To clear the products of metabo-lism, the kidneys must excrete a minimum of 500 to 800 mL of urine per day, regardless of the amount of oral intake.The typical individual consumes 3 to 5 g of dietary salt per day, with the balance maintained by the kidneys.

As depicted in Fig. 2.1 , there are multiple inputs and outputs of water, many of which can vary but nevertheless cannot be regulated. For example, the amount of water lost through the lungs depends on the humidity of the air and the rate of respiration (e.g., low humidity and rapid breathing increase water loss from the lungs). Similarly, the amount of water lost as sweat varies according to ambient temperature and physical activity. Finally, water loss via the gastrointestinal tract can increase from a normal level of 100 to 200 mL/day to many liters with acute diarrhea. Of these inputs and outputs, the only two", "ejection of blood by the left ventricle and diminished peripheral runoff during the brief ventricular ejection period (see also During exhaustive exercise, the compensatory mechanisms begin to fail. The heart rate attains a maximal level of approximately 180 beats per minute, and stroke volume reaches a plateau. The heart rate may then decrease, which results in a fall in blood pressure. The exercising individual also frequently becomes dehydrated. Sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity supersedes the vasodilator influence on vessels of the skin so that the rate of heat loss is decreased. Body temperature is normally elevated during exercise. A reduction in heat loss through cutaneous vasoconstriction can lead to very high body temperatures and to acute distress during severe exercise. Tissue pH and blood pH decrease as a result of", "dilate. However, when the heart rate becomes maximal during severe exercise, the skin vessels constrict. This increases the effective blood volume but causes greater increases in body temperature and a feeling of exhaustion. The limiting factor in exercise performance is delivery of blood to the active muscles. 6. Acute blood loss induces tachycardia, hypotension, generalized arteriolar constriction, and generalized venoconstriction. Acute blood loss invokes a number of negative feedback (compensatory) mechanisms, such as baroreceptor and chemoreceptor reflexes, responses to moderate cerebral ischemia, reabsorption of tissue fluids, release of endogenous vasoconstrictors, and renal conservation of water and electrolytes. Acute blood loss also invokes a number of positive feedback (decompensatory) mechanisms, such as cardiac failure, acidosis, central nervous system depression, aberrations in blood coagulation, and depression of the mononuclear phagocytic", "load is complex and involves the central nervous system (CNS), thermosensors, and thermoregulatory effectors. The central thermostat activates the effectors that produce peripheral vasodilation and sweating. The skin surface is in effect the radiator and the principal location of heat loss, since skin blood flow can increase 25\u201330 times over the basal rate. This dramatic increase in skin blood flow, coupled with the maintenance of peripheral vasodilation, efficiently radiates heat. At the same time, there is a compensatory vasoconstriction of the splanchnic and renal beds. Acclimatization to heat reflects a constellation of physiologic adaptations that permit the body to lose heat more efficiently. This process often requires one to several weeks of exposure and work in a hot environment. During acclimatization, the thermoregulatory set point is altered, and", "losses beyond the daily average must be replaced by appropriate solutions. The choice of solutions for replacement depends on the composition of the \ufb02uids lost. Often, it is difficult to measure free water loss, particularly in patients who have high losses from the lungs, skin, or the gastrointestinal tract. Weighing these patients daily can be very useful. Up to 300 g of weight loss daily can be attributable to weight loss from catabolism of protein and fat in the patient who is taking nothing by mouth (26). Any loss beyond this level represents \ufb02uid loss, which should be replaced accordingly. Patients with a high fever can have increased pulmonary and skin loss of free water, sometimes in excess of 2 to 3 L per day. These losses should", "not insensible and, in contrast to evaporative losses, sweat contains water and electrolytes. A variety of clinical situations modify normal maintenance water balance (Table 33-2). Evaporative skin water losses can be higher in neonates, especially premature infants who are under radiant warmers or undergoing phototherapy. Burns can result in massive losses of water and electrolytes (see Chapter 44). Fever increases insensible losses. Tachypnea or a tracheostomy increases evaporative losses from the lungs. The gastrointestinal tract is potentially a source of considerable water and electrolyte losses. A child who has large amounts of gastrointestinal losses should have these losses measured and replaced with an appropriate replacement solution (Table 33-3).

The glucose in maintenance fluids provides approximately 20% of the normal caloric needs of the patient.

CHAPTER SUMMARY A fatty acid, generally a linear hydrocarbon chain with a terminal carboxyl group, can be saturated or unsaturated. Two unsaturated fatty acids are dietary essentials: linoleic and \u03b1-linolenic acids. Fatty acids are synthesized in the liver cytosol following a meal containing excess carbohydrate and protein. Carbons used to synthesize fatty acids are provided by acetyl coenzyme A (CoA), energy by ATP, and reducing equivalents by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ([NADPH], Fig. 16.25) provided by the pentose phosphate pathway and malic enzyme. Citrate carries two-carbon acetyl units from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytosol. The regulated step in fatty acid synthesis is the carboxylation", "alcohol. Because alcohol consumption can also increase the risk for hypoglycemia in patients using insulin, those in an intensive insulin treatment protocol (see p. 340) are counseled about the increased risk of hypoglycemia that generally occurs many hours after alcohol ingestion. B. Inhibition of gluconeogenesis resulting from hepatic metabolism of ethanol. NAD(H) = nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. Chronic alcohol consumption can also result in alcoholic fatty liver because of increased hepatic synthesis of TAG coupled with impaired formation or release of VLDL. This occurs as a result of decreased FA oxidation because of a fall in the NAD+/NADH ratio and increased lipogenesis because of the increased availability of FA (decreased catabolism) and of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (the dehydrogenase is inhibited by the low NAD+/NADH ratio; see p. 101).

Lipids in a 10% to 20% emulsion can be given as further caloric supplement and supply the essential fatty acids, linoleic acid, and \u03b1-linoleic acids. More calories can be given in the form of free fatty acids, which are the major source of energy for most peripheral tissues. When lipids are used as a major source of calories, a minimum of 50 to 150 g per day of glucose should also be given to provide a substrate for the central nervous system. Most patients can tolerate up to 2 g of fat per kilogram of weight per day, and", "or compromised by a specific diagnosis as well as on any comorbidities that are present. More than one day\u2019s intake should be reviewed to provide a better representation of the usual diet. There are many ways to assess the adequacy of a patient\u2019s habitual diet. These include use of a food guide, a food-exchange list, a diet history, or a food-frequency questionnaire. A commonly used food guide for healthy persons is the USDA\u2019s Choose My Plate, which is useful as a rough guide for avoiding inadequate intakes of essential nutrients as well as likely excesses in the amounts of fat (especially saturated and trans fats), sodium, sugar, and alcohol consumed (Table 95e-4).

Because 2,3-BPG decreases the oxygen affinity of hemoglobin, a reduction in 2,3-BPG should result in increased oxygen affinity and decreased oxygen (O2) delivery to tissues. The relaxed form is the high-oxygen-affinity form of hemoglobin. Increased oxygen affinity (decreased delivery) results in a left shift in the oxygen-dissociation curve.

Obstructed labor can occur in rural areas where girls are married young (sometimes as early as 9 to 10 years of age) and where transportation is poor and access to medical services is limited.

Selection of the route of hysterectomy must be done considering the anatomy, the disorder or disease state, the patient\u2019s wishes, and the training and experience of the surgeon. Laparoscopic hysterectomy offers no advantage for women in whom vaginal hysterectomy is possible because the endoscopic approach is more expensive and probably has a higher risk for perioperative morbidity (51).

Two major features of the muscle cell make extremely rapid contraction possible.

When cytosolic Ca2+ concentration is low, as in relaxed muscle, the reaction cannot proceed because tropomyosin and the troponin complex on the thin filament do not allow the active sites on actin to interact with the cross-bridges.

Smooth muscle can contract in response to either electrical or hormonal signals and exhibits the ability to remain contracted for extended periods at low levels of energy consumption, which is important for functions such as maintaining vascular tone and hence blood pressure. Thus regulation of contraction of smooth muscle is complex, sometimes involving multiple intracellular signaling cascades. In the present chapter, effort is made to identify mechanisms underlying this diverse regulation of smooth muscle contraction and, when appropriate, compare these regulatory mechanisms with those observed in striated muscle.", "(see page 316). The change in molecular conformation of TnC causes the TnI to dissociate from the actin molecules, allowing the troponin complex to uncover myosin-binding sites on the actin molecules. The myosin heads are now free to interact with actin molecules to initiate the muscle contraction cycle. Simultaneously, a Ca2-activated ATPase pump in the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum transports Ca2 back into the terminal cisternae. The resting concentration of Ca2 is restored in the cytosol in less than 30 milliseconds. This restoration of resting Ca2 concentration near the myo filaments normally causes contraction to stop.

Glucose is transported from the blood to the brain by an active carrier system. Glucose entering the brain either undergoes glycolysis or is stored as glycogen. During normal oxygenation (aerobic metabolism), glucose is converted to pyruvate, which enters the Krebs cycle; with anaerobic metabolism, lactate is formed.

With type Ia, the liver is unable to generate free glucose either from glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis because both processes produce glucose 6phosphate. With type VI, the liver is still able to produce free glucose from gluconeogenesis, but glycogenolysis is inhibited. For additional ancillary materials related to this chapter, please visit thePoint.

LIVER IN FASTING The primary role of the liver in fasting is maintenance of blood glucose through the production of glucose (from glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis) for glucose-requiring tissues and the synthesis and distribution of ketone bodies for use by other tissues. Therefore, hepatic metabolism is distinguished from peripheral (or extrahepatic) metabolism. A. Carbohydrate metabolism The liver first uses glycogen degradation and then gluconeogenesis to maintain blood glucose levels to sustain energy metabolism of the brain and other glucose-requiring tissues in the fasted state. [Note: Recall that the presence of glucose-6-phosphatase in the liver allows the production of free glucose both from glycogenolysis and", "1-phosphate is converted to glucose 6-phosphate by phosphoglucomutase. In muscle, glucose 6phosphate enters glycolysis. In liver, the phosphate is removed by glucose 6-phosphatase (an enzyme of the endoplasmic reticular membrane), releasing free glucose that can be used to maintain blood glucose levels at the beginning of a fast. A deficiency of the phosphatase causes glycogen storage disease Ia (von Gierke disease) and results in an inability of the liver to provide free glucose to the body during a fast. It affects both glycogen degradation and gluconeogenesis. Glycogen synthesis and degradation are reciprocally regulated to meet whole-body needs by the same hormonal signals (namely, an elevated insulin level results in overall increased glycogenesis and decreased glycogenolysis, whereas an elevated glucagon, or epinephrine, level causes the opposite effects). Key enzymes", "three categories ( Table 7.4 Hepatic type. Liver contains several enzymes that synthesize glycogen for storage and also break it down into free glucose. Hence, a deficiency of the hepatic enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism is associated with two major clinical effects: enlargement of the liver due to storage of glycogen and hypoglycemia due to a failure of glucose production ( Fig. 7.12 ). Von Gierke disease (type I glycogenosis), resulting from a lack of glucose-6phosphatase, is the most important example of the hepatic form of glycogenosis ( Table 7.4 Myopathic type. In striated muscle, glycogen is an important source of energy. Not surprisingly, most forms of glycogen storage disease affect muscles. When enzymes that are involved in glycolysis are deficient, glycogen storage occurs in muscles and there", "maintenance of blood glucose during the fasting phase: hepatic glucose production and glucose sparing. Hepatic glucose production is in turn based on two metabolic pathways. The first is the rapid catabolic process of glycogenolysis (pathway 9 in Fig. 39.3B ).

Luteal hormonal output is absolutely dependent on basal LH levels (see Fig. 44.22 ). In fact, progesterone output is closely correlated with the pulsatile pattern of LH release in women. Both FSH and LH are reduced to basal levels during the luteal phase by negative feedback from progesterone and estrogen. In addition, granulosa lutein cells secrete inhibin, which selectively represses FSH secretion.

Hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) simultaneously regulates both luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in the pituitary by being secreted in a pulsatile manner. The pulse frequency determines the relative amounts of LH and FSH secretion. The ovary responds to FSH and LH in a defined, sequential manner to produce follicular growth, ovulation, and corpus luteum formation. The cycle is designed to produce an optimal environment for pregnancy; if pregnancy does not occur, the cycle begins again.

In preterm infants, this is caused by lung immaturity and insuicient surfactantrespiratory distress syndrome (DS}-and variants may be seen in severely ill older children and adults (Chap. 47, p. 918).

Surfactant is synthesized by type II pneumocytes and, with the healthy newborn\u2019s first breath, rapidly coats the surface of alveoli, reducing surface tension and thus decreasing the pressure required to keep the alveoli open. In a lung deficient in surfactant, alveoli tend to collapse, and a relatively greater inspiratory effort is required with each breath to open the alveoli. The infant rapidly tires from breathing and generalized atelectasis sets in. The resulting hypoxia sets into motion a sequence of events that leads to epithelial and endothelial damage and eventually to the formation of hyaline membranes ( Fig. 7.24 ).

Surfactant deficiency\u2013induced atelectasis causes alveoli to be perfused but not ventilated, which results in a pulmonary shunt and hypoxemia. As atelectasis increases, the lungs become increasingly difficult to expand, and lung compliance decreases. Because the chest wall of the premature infant is very compliant, the infant attempts to overcome decreased lung compliance with increasing inspiratory pressures, resulting in retractions of the chest wall. The sequence of decreased lung compliance and chest wall retractions leads to poor air exchange, an increased physiologic dead space, alveolar hypoventilation, and hypercapnia.", "malformations involving thoracic structures, such as diaphragmatic hernia. Common mutations in surfactant protein production and the phospholipid transporter (ABCA3) contribute to RDS (Beers, 2017; Tredano, 2003; Wert, 2009). An important factor inluencing survival is neonatal intensive care. Although hypoxemia prompts supplemental oxygen, excess oxygen can damage the pulmonary epithelium, retina, and other immature tissues. Despite this, advances in mechanical ventilation technology have improved neonatal survival rates. For example, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) prevents the collapse of unstable alveoli. This allows high inspired-oxygen concentrations to be reduced, thereby minimizing its toxicity. In an attempt to minimize the need for tracheal intubation and intermittent positive-pressure ventilation, CPAP has been studied in well-designed multicenter trials (Morley, 2008; SUPPORT Study Group, 2010b). An initial CPAP strategy with subsequent selective surfactant use", "respiratory distress syndrome of the newborn; the latter is caused by a deficiency of surfactant caused by prematurity. In ARDS, the integrity of the alveolar-capillary membrane is compromised by endothelial and epithelial injury. Most work suggests that ARDS stems from an inflammatory reaction initiated by a variety of pro-inflammatory mediators ( Fig. 13.2 ). As early as 30 minutes after an acute insult, there is increased synthesis of interleukin 8 (IL-8), a potent neutrophil chemotactic and activating agent, by pulmonary macrophages. Release of IL-8 and other factors, such as IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), leads to endothelial activation and sequestration and activation of neutrophils in pulmonary capillaries. Neutrophils are thought to have an important role in the pathogenesis of ARDS. Histologic examination of lungs early in the", "walls and surfactant deficiency may result in poor air exchange, retractions, hypoxia, and apnea. The newborn (particularly a preterm infant) responds paradoxically to hypoxia with apnea rather than tachypnea as occurs in adults. Episodes of intrauterine asphyxia also may depress the neonatal central nervous system. If recovery of the fetal heart rate occurs as a result of improved uteroplacental perfusion, fetal hypoxia and acidosis may resolve. Nonetheless, if the effect on the respiratory center is more severe, a newborn may not initiate an adequate ventilatory response at birth and may undergo another episode of asphyxia. The Apgar examination, a rapid scoring system based on physiologic responses to the birth process, is a good method for assessing the need to resuscitate a newborn (Table 58-8).At intervals of 1 minute", "neurological damage such as cerebral palsy.

Given together, antenatal corticosteroids and surfactant result in an even greater reduction in the overall death rate. However, randomized trials indicate that in populations with high use of antenatal steroids and routine use of CP P in the delivery room, prophylactant surfactant is no longer beneficial and is associated with more risk of death or BPD (Rojas-Reyes, 2012; Sardesai, 2017). Exploration of diferent, less invasive ways to deliver rescue surfactant to spontaneously breathing preterm neonates is currently underway. Potential routes include surfactant application into the pharynx, surfactant nebulization, or application via laryngeal mask or via a thin catheter placed in the trachea (Kribs, 2016).

According to Boyle\u2019s law, when temperature is constant, pressure (P) and volume (V) are inversely related; that is, Boyle\u2019s law is used in the measurement of lung volumes (see Fig. 21.4 ). Dalton\u2019s law is that the partial pressure of a gas in a gas mixture is the pressure that the gas would exert if it occupied the total volume of the mixture in the absence of the other components. Eq. 23.7 is an example of how Dalton\u2019s law is used in the lung. According to Henry\u2019s law, the concentration of a gas dissolved in a liquid is proportional to its partial pressure. The second important principle is that the partial pressure of a gas", "pressures of O2, N2, and water vapor in humidified air remain unchanged in the airways until the gas reaches the alveolus. 3. The partial pressure of O2 in the alveolus is given by the alveolar air equation ( Eq. 23.13 ). This equation is used to calculate the AaDO2, a useful measurement of abnormal arterial O2. 4. The relationship between CO2 production and alveolar ventilation is defined by the alveolar carbon Eq. 23.14 ). There is an inverse relationship between the PACO2 and VA, regardless of the exhaled quantity of CO2. In normal lungs, PaCO2 is tightly regulated to remain constant at around 40 mm Hg. 5.

The composition of this gas mixture can be described in terms of either gas fractions or the corresponding partial pressure. Because ambient air is a gas, the gas laws can be applied, from which two important principles arise. The first is that when the components are viewed in terms of gas fractions (F), the sum of the individual gas fractions must equal one: Equation 23.6 1 0. = FN2 + FO2", "Pao2 cannot be restored to normal with inspiration of 100% O2. Anemic Hypoxia A reduction in hemoglobin concentration of the blood is accompanied by a corresponding decline in the O2-carrying capacity of the blood. Although the Pao2 is normal in anemic hypoxia, the absolute quantity of O2 transported per unit volume of blood is diminished. As the anemic blood passes through the capillaries and the usual quantity of O2 is removed from it, the Po2 and saturation in the venous blood decline to a greater extent than normal. Carbon Monoxide (CO) Intoxication (See also Chap. 472e) Hemoglobin that binds with CO (carboxy-hemoglobin, COHb) is unavailable for O2 transport.

Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week\u2026 The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)\u2026Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F, or normal) to 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and then rapidly increasing to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F)\u2026  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance\u2026 Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor.

PART 2 Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseases Although most patients with elevated body temperature have fever, there are circumstances in which elevated temperature represents not fever but hyperthermia (heat stroke). Hyperthermia is characterized by an uncontrolled increase in body temperature that exceeds the body\u2019s ability to lose heat. The setting of the hypothalamic thermoregulatory center is unchanged. In contrast to fever in infections, hyperthermia does not involve pyrogenic molecules. Exogenous heat exposure and endogenous heat production are two mechanisms by which hyperthermia can result in dangerously high internal temperatures. Excessive heat production can easily cause hyperthermia despite physiologic and behavioral control of body temperature. For example, work or exercise in hot environments can produce heat faster than peripheral mechanisms can lose it.", "The immediate defense of thermoneutrality is via the autonomic nervous system, whereas delayed control is mediated by the endocrine system. Autonomic nervous system responses include the release of norepinephrine, increased muscle tone, and shivering, leading to thermogenesis and an increase in the basal metabolic rate. Cutaneous cold thermoreception causes direct reflex vasoconstriction to conserve heat. Prolonged exposure to cold also stimulates the thyroid axis, leading to an increased metabolic rate. In most cases of hypothermia, the history of exposure to environmental factors (e.g., prolonged exposure to the outdoors without adequate clothing) makes the diagnosis straightforward. In urban settings, however, the presentation is often more subtle, and other disease processes, toxin exposures, or psychiatric diagnoses should be considered. After initial stimulation by hypothermia, there is progressive depression of all", "period of collapse, which is usually brief, equilibrium is spontaneously reestablished if the victim is able to rehydrate. Heat stroke is associated with high ambient temperatures and high humidity. Thermoregulatory mechanisms fail, sweating ceases, and core body temperature rises. In the clinical setting, a rectal temperature of 106\u00b0F or higher is considered a grave prognostic sign, and the mortality rate for such patients exceeds 50%. The underlying mechanism is marked generalized peripheral vasodilation with peripheral pooling of blood and a decreased effective circulating blood volume. Necrosis of the muscles and myocardium may occur. Arrhythmias, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and other systemic effects are common. Elderly people, persons with cardiovascular disease, and otherwise healthy people undergoing physical stress (such as young athletes and military recruits) are prime candidates for heat", "coagulation, and other systemic effects are common. Elderly people, persons with cardiovascular disease, and otherwise healthy people undergoing physical stress (such as young athletes and military recruits) are prime candidates for heat stroke. \u2022 Malignant hyperthermia, although similar sounding, is not caused by exposure to high temperatures. It is a genetic condition resulting from mutations in genes such as RYR1 that control calcium levels in skeletal muscle cells. In affected individuals, exposure to certain anesthetics during surgery may trigger a rapid rise in calcium levels in skeletal muscle, which in turn leads to muscle rigidity and increased heat production. The resulting hyperthermia has a mortality rate of approximately 80% if untreated, but this falls to less than 5% if the condition is recognized and muscle relaxants are administered", "ejection of blood by the left ventricle and diminished peripheral runoff during the brief ventricular ejection period (see also During exhaustive exercise, the compensatory mechanisms begin to fail. The heart rate attains a maximal level of approximately 180 beats per minute, and stroke volume reaches a plateau. The heart rate may then decrease, which results in a fall in blood pressure. The exercising individual also frequently becomes dehydrated. Sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity supersedes the vasodilator influence on vessels of the skin so that the rate of heat loss is decreased. Body temperature is normally elevated during exercise. A reduction in heat loss through cutaneous vasoconstriction can lead to very high body temperatures and to acute distress during severe exercise.

Lack of sweating after a hot bath, during exercise, or on a hot day can suggest sudomotor failure. OH (also called orthostatic or postural hypotension) is perhaps the most disabling feature of autonomic dysfunction. The prevalence of OH is relatively high, especially when OH associated with aging and diabetes mellitus is included (Table 454-4). OH can cause a variety of symptoms, including dimming or loss of vision, lightheadedness, diaphoresis, diminished hearing, pallor, and weakness. Syncope results when the drop in BP impairs cerebral perfusion. Other manifestations of impaired baroreflexes are supine hypertension, a heart rate that is fixed regardless of posture, postprandial hypotension, and an excessively high nocturnal BP. Many patients with OH have a", "cold pressor test. In normal persons, immersing one hand in ice water for 1 to 5 min raises the systolic pressure by 15 to 20 mm Hg and the diastolic pressure by 10 to 15 mm Hg. Similarly, the sustained isometric contraction of a group of muscles (e.g., those of the forearm in handgrip) for 5 min normally increases the heart rate and the systolic and diastolic pressures by at least 15 mm Hg.

In acute myocardial infarction associated with low cardiac output, hypothermia may be reversed after adequate resuscitation.

Clinical trials have demonstrated that the optimal times of preprandial subcutaneous injection of comparable doses of the rapid-acting insulin analogs and of regular human insulin are 15 minutes and 45 minutes before the meal, respectively.

Attempts to improve exercise tolerance with frequent meals and a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet, or by substituting medium-chain triglycerides in the diet, have not proven to be beneficial. Myoadenylate Deaminase Deficiency The muscle enzyme myoadenylate deaminase converts adenosine-5\u2032-monophosphate (5\u2032-AMP) to inosine monophosphate (IMP) with liberation of ammonia. Myoadenylate deaminase may play a role in regulating adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels in muscles. Most individuals with myoadenylate deaminase deficiency have no symptoms. There have been a few reports of patients with this disorder who have exercise-exacerbated myalgia and myoglobinuria. Many questions have been raised about the clinical effects of myoadenylate deaminase deficiency, and, specifically, its relationship to exertional myalgia and fatigability, but there is no consensus. In 1972, Olson and colleagues recognized", "DM should (1) monitor blood glucose before, during, and after exercise; (2) delay exercise if blood glucose is >14 mmol/L (250 mg/ dL) and ketones are present; (3) if the blood glucose is <5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL), ingest carbohydrate before exercising; (4) monitor glu cose during exercise and ingest carbohydrate to prevent hypoglycemia; (5) decrease insulin doses (based on previous experience) before exercise and inject insulin into a nonexercising area; and (6) learn individual glucose responses to different types of exercise and increase food intake for up to 24 h after exercise, depending on intensity and duration of exercise.

Thus, muscle failure at a certain phase of exercise is predictive of the type of energy failure. A rising blood concentration of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate reflects the increasing oxidation of fatty acids, and an increase in blood lactate reflects the anaerobic metabolism of glucose. The cytochrome oxidative mechanisms are essential in both aerobic and anaerobic muscle metabolism; these mechanisms are considered in Chap. 36 in relation to the mitochondrial diseases in which muscle tissue is prominently involved, and they are referred to here only briefly. It follows from these", "of high-intensity exercise or prolonged exercise, the myoplasmic ATP level does not decrease substantially. In view of the reliance of all cells on the availability of ATP to maintain viability, fatigue has been described as a protective mechanism to minimize the risk of muscle cell injury or death. Consequently, it is likely that skeletal muscle cells have developed redundant systems to ensure that ATP levels do not drop to dangerously low levels and hence risk the viability of the cell. Most persons tire and cease exercise long before the motor unit fatigues. General physical fatigue may be defined as a homeostatic disturbance produced by work.

Of importance is that the decline in force/ stress occurs when the ATP pool is not greatly reduced, so that the muscle fibers do not go into rigor.

The net results of these actions are most apparent in the fasting state, when the supply of glucose from gluconeogenesis, the release of amino acids from muscle catabolism, the inhibition of peripheral glucose uptake, and the stimulation of lipolysis all contribute to maintenance of an adequate glucose supply to the brain.

Metabolic Effects The glucocorticoids have important dose-related effects on carbohydrate, protein, and fat metabolism. The same effects are responsible for some of the serious adverse effects associated with their use in therapeutic doses.

Glucagon and epinephrine: Secretion of these counterregulatory hormones is most important in the acute, short-term regulation of blood glucose levels. Glucagon stimulates hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Epinephrine promotes glycogenolysis and lipolysis. It inhibits insulin secretion, thereby preventing GLUT-4\u2013mediated uptake of glucose by muscle and adipose tissues. Epinephrine assumes a critical role in hypoglycemia when glucagon secretion is deficient, for example, in the late stages of type 1 diabetes mellitus (see p. 340). The prevention or correction of hypoglycemia fails when the secretion of both glucagon and epinephrine is deficient. 2. Cortisol and", "begins if no food is ingested after the absorptive period. It may result from an inability to obtain food, the desire to lose weight rapidly, or clinical situations in which an individual cannot eat (for example, because of trauma, surgery, cancer, or burns). In the absence of food, plasma levels of glucose, amino acids, and TAG fall, triggering a decline in insulin secretion and an increase in glucagon, epinephrine, and cortisol secretion. The decreased insulin/counterregulatory hormone ratio and the decreased availability of circulating substrates make the postabsorptive period of nutrient deprivation a catabolic period characterized by degradation of TAG, glycogen, and protein. This sets into motion an exchange of substrates among the liver, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and brain that is guided by two priorities: 1) the need", "stimulating gluconeogenesis ( Fig. 43.10 ). Cortisol enhances gene expression of the key hepatic gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). Cortisol also decreases GLUT4-mediated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. During the interdigestive period (low insulin-glucagon ratio), cortisol promotes glucose sparing by potentiating the effects of catecholamines on lipolysis, thereby making FFAs available as energy sources. Cortisol inhibits protein synthesis and increases proteolysis, especially in skeletal muscle, thereby providing a rich source of carbon for hepatic gluconeogenesis.

Interestingly, although glucocorti-coid infusion alone does not increase glucose levels, it does pro-long and augment the hyperglycemic effects of catecholamines and glucagon when glucocorticoid is administered concurrently with the latter.Glycogen stores within skeletal muscles can be mobilized by epinephrine activation of b-adrenergic receptors, GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins), which subsequently activates the second messenger, cAMP. The cAMP activates phosphorylase kinase, which in turn leads to conversion of glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate. Phosphorylase kinase also can be activated by the second messenger, calcium, through the breakdown of phos-phatidylinositol phosphate, which is the case in vasopressin-mediated hepatic glycogenolysis.243Protein and Amino Acid MetabolismThe average protein intake in healthy young adults ranges from 80 to 120 g/d, and every 6 g of protein yields approximately 1 g", "PK to its inactive (phosphorylated) form.

Glutamine, produced by the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids in muscle, is deaminated by glutaminase to ammonia + glutamate. The glutamate is deaminated by glutamate dehydrogenase to ammonia + \u03b1ketoglutarate, which can be used for gluconeogenesis.

In the liver, Ala is transaminated by alanine transaminase (ALT) to pyruvate (used in gluconeogenesis) and glutamate. Thus, Ala carries nitrogen to the liver for conversion to urea (see figure below). Therefore, defects in the urea cycle would result in an elevation in NH3, Gln, and Ala.

The glutamate product of ALT can be deaminated by GDH, generating ammonia. Thus, both alanine and glutamine carry ammonia to the liver. V.

Protein metabolism During the first few days of fasting, there is a rapid breakdown of muscle protein (for example, glycolytic enzymes), providing amino acids that are used by the liver for gluconeogenesis (see Fig. 24.15, ). Because muscle does not have glucagon receptors, muscle proteolysis is initiated by a fall in insulin and sustained by a rise in glucocorticoids. [Note: Alanine and glutamine are quantitatively the most important glucogenic amino acids released from muscle. They are produced by the catabolism of BCAA (see p. 267).

The energetically favorable reaction of ATP hydrolysis is coupled to many otherwise unfavorable reactions through which other molecules are synthesized. Many of these coupled reactions involve the transfer of the terminal phosphate in ATP to another molecule, as illustrated by the phosphorylation reaction in Figure 2\u201334.

The Nature of Primary Metabolic Myopathies The chemical energy for muscle contraction is provided by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP); ATP is restored by phosphocreatine and ADP acting in combination. These reactions are particularly important during brief, high-intensity exercise. During periods of prolonged muscle activity, rephosphorylation requires the availability of carbohydrates, fatty acids, and ketones, which are catabolized in mitochondria. Glycogen is the main sarcoplasmic source of carbohydrate, but blood glucose also moves freely in and out of muscle cells as needed during sustained exercise. The fatty acids in the blood, derived mainly from adipose tissue and intracellular lipid stores, constitute the other major source of energy. Carbohydrate is metabolized during aerobic and", "by muscle decline rapidly, and these changes have important health and functional consequences. Balance Between Energy Availability and Energy demand Release of phosphate from ATP provides every living cell with the energy required for life. However, the storage of ATP is only enough for 6 sec; therefore, ATP is constantly resynthesized. Although ATP can be resynthesized by anaerobic glycolysis, most of the energy used in the body is generated through aerobic metabolism. Therefore, energy consumption is usually estimated indirectly by oxygen consumption (indirect calorimetry). There is currently no method to measure true \u201cfitness,\u201d which is the maximal energy that can be produced by an organism over extended periods. Thus, fitness is estimated indirectly from peak oxygen consumption (MVo ), often during a maximal treadmill test. gressively with aging", "needed during sustained exercise. The fatty acids in the blood, derived mainly from adipose tissue and intracellular lipid stores, constitute the other major source of energy. Carbohydrate is metabolized during aerobic and anaerobic phases of metabolism; the fatty acids are metabolized only aerobically. Resting muscle derives approximately 70 percent of its energy from the oxidation of long-chain fatty acids. As stated earlier, the circumstances during exercise are somewhat different. During a short period of intense exercise, the muscle uses carbohydrate derived from glycogen stores; myophosphorylase is the enzyme that initiates the metabolism of glycogen. With longer aerobic exercise, blood flow to muscle and the availability of glucose and fatty acids are increased. At first, glucose is the main source of energy during exercise; later, with exhaustion of glycogen", "fibers to endurance exercise is mainly the result of an increase in the oxidative metabolic capacity of the motor units involved. This demand places an increased load on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems and increases the capacity of the heart and respiratory muscles. The latter effects are responsible for the principal health benefits associated with endurance exercise. Muscle strength can be increased by regular massive efforts that involve most motor units. Such efforts recruit fast glycolytic motor units, as well as slow oxidative motor units. During these efforts, blood supply to the working muscles may be interrupted as tissue pressures rise above intravascular pressure. The reduced blood flow limits the duration of the contraction. Regular maximal-strength exercise, such as weightlifting, induces the synthesis of more myofibrils and hence", "glycogen, which are then metabolized by a combination of glycolysis (in the cytosol) and oxidative phosphorylation (in the mitochondria) to yield the equivalent of 37 mol of ATP per mole of glucose 1-phosphate. Blood glucose yields 36 mol of ATP per mole of glucose because 1 ATP is used to phosphorylate glucose at the start of glycolysis. These ATP yields, however, are dependent on an adequate oxygen supply. Under anaerobic conditions, in contrast, metabolism of glycogen and glucose yields only 3 and 2 mol of ATP per mole of glucose 1-phosphate and glucose, respectively (along with 2 mol of lactate). As discussed later, muscle fatigue during prolonged exercise is associated with depletion of glycogen stores in the muscle. Fatty acids represent an important source of energy for muscle", "aerobic exercise, blood flow to muscle and the availability of glucose and fatty acids are increased. At first, glucose is the main source of energy during exercise; later, with exhaustion of glycogen stores, energy is provided by oxidation of fatty acids. Thus, muscle failure at a certain phase of exercise is predictive of the type of energy failure. A rising blood concentration of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate reflects the increasing oxidation of fatty acids, and an increase in blood lactate reflects the anaerobic metabolism of glucose. The cytochrome oxidative mechanisms are essential in both aerobic and anaerobic muscle metabolism; these mechanisms are considered in Chap. 36 in relation to the mitochondrial diseases in which muscle tissue is prominently involved, and they are referred to here only briefly. It follows from these", "although the accumulation of various metabolic products (lactate, Pi, ADP) has been implicated. In view of the importance of preventing depletion of myoplasmic ATP, which would affect the viability of the cell, it is likely that multiple mechanisms may have been developed to induce fatigue and hence lower the rate of ATP hydrolysis before the individual risks injury or death of the skeletal muscle cell. 11. When the energy demands of an exercising muscle cannot be met by oxidative metabolism, an oxygen debt is incurred. Increased breathing during the recovery period after exercise reflects this oxygen debt. The greater the reliance on anaerobic metabolism to meet the energy requirements of muscle contraction, the greater the oxygen debt. Gordon AM, Homsher E, Regnier M.

This decay represents the rapid and almost total failure of the fast motor units.

Of importance is that the decline in force/ stress occurs when the ATP pool is not greatly reduced, so that the muscle fibers do not go into rigor.

Genetic information is also fundamental to life, and free energy is required for the propagation of this information.

From a chemical point of view, proteins are by far the most structurally complex and functionally sophisticated molecules known. This is perhaps not surprising, once we realize that the structure and chemistry of each protein has been developed and fine-tuned over billions of years of evolutionary history. The theoretical calculations of population geneticists reveal that, over evolutionary time periods, a surprisingly small selective advantage is enough to cause a randomly altered protein sequence to spread through a population of organisms. Yet, even to experts, the remarkable versatility of proteins can seem truly amazing. In this section, we consider how the location of each amino acid in the long string of amino acids that forms a protein determines its", "a standard way to any other amino acid in the set; attached to this core is a side group that gives each amino acid a distinctive chemical character. Each of the protein molecules is a polypeptide, created by joining its amino acids in a particular sequence. Through billions of years of evolution, this sequence has been selected to give the protein a useful function. Thus, by folding into a precise three-dimensional form with reactive sites on its surface (Figure 1\u20137A), these amino-acid polymers can bind with high specificity to other molecules and can act as enzymes to catalyze reactions that make or break covalent bonds. In this way they direct the vast majority of chemical processes in the cell (Figure 1\u20137B).

Mutant bacteria with a specific alteration in the small ribosomal subunit have longer delays and translate mRNA into protein with an accuracy considerably higher than this; however, protein synthesis is so slow in these mutants that the bacteria are barely able to survive. We have also seen that attaining the observed accuracy of protein synthesis requires the expenditure of a great deal of free energy; this is expected, since, as discussed in Chapter 2, there is a price to be paid for any increase in order in the cell.

Partly to allow time for growth, most cell cycles have gap phases\u2014a G1 phase between M phase and S phase and a G2 phase between S phase and mitosis. Thus, the eukaryotic cell cycle is traditionally divided into four sequential phases: G1, S, G2, and M. G1, S, and G2 together are called interphase (Figure 17\u20134, and see Figure 17\u20133). In a typical human cell proliferating in culture, interphase might occupy 23 hours of a 24-hour cycle, with 1 hour for M phase. Cell growth occurs throughout the cell cycle, except during mitosis. The two gap phases are more than simple time", "those of the parental cell. The cell cycle incorporates two principal phases: the interphase, representing continuous growth of the cell, and the M phase (mitosis), characterized by the partition of the genome. Three other phases, G1 (gap1) phase, S (synthesis) phase, and G2 (gap2) phase, further subdivide interphase (Fig. 3.10). Rapidly renewing populations of human cells progress through the full cell cycle in about 24 hours. Throughout the cycle, several internal quality-control mechanisms or checkpoints represented by biochemical pathways control transition between cell-cycle stages. The cell cycle stops at several checkpoints and can only proceed if certain conditions are met\u2014for example, if the cell has reached a certain size. Checkpoints monitor and modulate the progression of cells through the cell cycle in response to intracellular or environmental signals.", "S phase and transition through G2, the cell undergoes the dramatic upheaval of M phase. This begins with mitosis, during which the sister chromatids are separated and distributed (segregated) to a pair of identical daughter nuclei, each with its own copy of the genome. Mitosis is traditionally divided into five stages\u2014prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase\u2014defined primarily on the basis of chromosome behavior as seen in a microscope. As mitosis is completed, the second major event of M phase\u2014cytokinesis\u2014divides the cell into two halves, each with an identical nucleus. Panel 17\u20131 summarizes the major events of M phase (Movie 17.2, Movie 17.3, Movie 17.4, and Movie 17.5). From a regulatory point of view, mitosis can be divided into two major parts, each governed by distinct components of the", "cells occurs only during a specific part of the cell-division cycle, called the DNA synthesis phase or S phase (Figure 5\u201329). In a mammalian cell, the S phase typically lasts for about 8 hours; in simpler eukaryotic cells such as yeasts, the S phase can be as short as 40 minutes. By its end, each chromosome has been replicated to produce two complete copies, which remain joined together at their centromeres until the M phase (M for mitosis), which soon follows. In Chapter 17, we describe the control system that runs the cell cycle, and we explain why entry into each phase of the cycle requires the cell to have successfully completed the previous phase. In the following sections, we explore how chromosome replication is coordinated within the", "extended periods. Two checkpoints monitor DNA quality: the G2 DNA-damage checkpoint and the unreplicated-DNA checkpoint. The latter checkpoint prevents the progression of the cell into the M phase before DNA synthesis is complete. Mitosis occurs in the M phase. Mitosis nearly always includes both karyokinesis (division of the nucleus) and cytokinesis (division of the cell) and lasts about 1 hour. Mitosis takes place in several stages described in more detail below. Separation of two identical daughter cells concludes the M phase. The M phase possesses two checkpoints: the spindle-assembly checkpoint, which prevents premature entry into anaphase, and the chromosome-segregation checkpoint, which prevents the process of cytokinesis until all of the chromosomes have been correctly separated.

By contrast, if Scc1 expression is turned on only after S phase is completed, the cells fail to divide and they die, even though Scc1 accumulates in the nucleus and interacts efficiently with chromosomes.", "(karyokinesis) and the cytoplasm (cytokinesis). The process of cytokinesis results in distribution of nonnuclear organelles into two daughter cells. Before entering mitosis, cells duplicate their DNA. This phase of the cell cycle is called the S or synthesis phase. At the beginning of this phase, the chromosome number is (2n), and the DNA content is also (2d); at the end, the chromosome number remains the same (2n), and the DNA content doubles to (4d). Mitosis follows the S phase of the cell cycle and is described in four phases.

This process is controlled at key checkpoints that monitor the status of a cell, for example, the amount of DNA present. The cell cycle is regulated by a small number of heterodimeric protein kinases that consist of a regulatory subunit (cyclin) and a catalytic subunit (cyclin-dependent kinase). Association of a cyclin with a cyclindependent kinase (CdkC) determines which proteins will be phosphorylated at a specific point during the cell cycle. Figure 6.2 The cell cycle.

Thus myocardial O2 consumption may not be well correlated with overall cardiac work. The magnitude and duration of left ventricular pressure are correlated with left ventricular O2 consumption. The work of the right ventricle is one-seventh that of the left ventricle because pulmonary vascular resistance is much less than systemic vascular resistance. The efficiency of the heart may be calculated as the ratio of the work accomplished to the total energy used.

Some amino acids have more than one tRNA and some tRNAs are constructed so that they require accurate base-pairing only at the first two positions of the codon and can tolerate a mismatch (or wobble) at the third position (Figure 6\u201351).

Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week\u2026 The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well.

The skin heats first, rising to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F, or normal) to 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and then rapidly increasing to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F)\u2026  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume.

This process often requires one to several weeks of exposure and work in a hot environment.

PART 2 Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseases Although most patients with elevated body temperature have fever, there are circumstances in which elevated temperature represents not fever but hyperthermia (heat stroke). Hyperthermia is characterized by an uncontrolled increase in body temperature that exceeds the body\u2019s ability to lose heat. The setting of the hypothalamic thermoregulatory center is unchanged. In contrast to fever in infections, hyperthermia does not involve pyrogenic molecules. Exogenous heat exposure and endogenous heat production are two mechanisms by which hyperthermia can result in dangerously high internal temperatures. Excessive heat production can easily cause hyperthermia despite physiologic and behavioral control of body temperature. For example, work or exercise in hot environments can produce heat faster than peripheral mechanisms can lose it.", "The immediate defense of thermoneutrality is via the autonomic nervous system, whereas delayed control is mediated by the endocrine system. Autonomic nervous system responses include the release of norepinephrine, increased muscle tone, and shivering, leading to thermogenesis and an increase in the basal metabolic rate. Cutaneous cold thermoreception causes direct reflex vasoconstriction to conserve heat. Prolonged exposure to cold also stimulates the thyroid axis, leading to an increased metabolic rate. In most cases of hypothermia, the history of exposure to environmental factors (e.g., prolonged exposure to the outdoors without adequate clothing) makes the diagnosis straightforward. In urban settings, however, the presentation is often more subtle, and other disease processes, toxin exposures, or psychiatric diagnoses should be considered. After initial stimulation by hypothermia, there is progressive depression of all", "period of collapse, which is usually brief, equilibrium is spontaneously reestablished if the victim is able to rehydrate. Heat stroke is associated with high ambient temperatures and high humidity. Thermoregulatory mechanisms fail, sweating ceases, and core body temperature rises. In the clinical setting, a rectal temperature of 106\u00b0F or higher is considered a grave prognostic sign, and the mortality rate for such patients exceeds 50%. The underlying mechanism is marked generalized peripheral vasodilation with peripheral pooling of blood and a decreased effective circulating blood volume. Necrosis of the muscles and myocardium may occur. Arrhythmias, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and other systemic effects are common. Elderly people, persons with cardiovascular disease, and otherwise healthy people undergoing physical stress (such as young athletes and military recruits) are prime candidates for heat", "coagulation, and other systemic effects are common. Elderly people, persons with cardiovascular disease, and otherwise healthy people undergoing physical stress (such as young athletes and military recruits) are prime candidates for heat stroke. \u2022 Malignant hyperthermia, although similar sounding, is not caused by exposure to high temperatures. It is a genetic condition resulting from mutations in genes such as RYR1 that control calcium levels in skeletal muscle cells. In affected individuals, exposure to certain anesthetics during surgery may trigger a rapid rise in calcium levels in skeletal muscle, which in turn leads to muscle rigidity and increased heat production. The resulting hyperthermia has a mortality rate of approximately 80% if untreated, but this falls to less than 5% if the condition is recognized and muscle relaxants are administered", "ejection of blood by the left ventricle and diminished peripheral runoff during the brief ventricular ejection period (see also During exhaustive exercise, the compensatory mechanisms begin to fail. The heart rate attains a maximal level of approximately 180 beats per minute, and stroke volume reaches a plateau. The heart rate may then decrease, which results in a fall in blood pressure. The exercising individual also frequently becomes dehydrated. Sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity supersedes the vasodilator influence on vessels of the skin so that the rate of heat loss is decreased. Body temperature is normally elevated during exercise. A reduction in heat loss through cutaneous vasoconstriction can lead to very high body temperatures and to acute distress during severe exercise.

Lack of sweating after a hot bath, during exercise, or on a hot day can suggest sudomotor failure. OH (also called orthostatic or postural hypotension) is perhaps the most disabling feature of autonomic dysfunction. The prevalence of OH is relatively high, especially when OH associated with aging and diabetes mellitus is included (Table 454-4). OH can cause a variety of symptoms, including dimming or loss of vision, lightheadedness, diaphoresis, diminished hearing, pallor, and weakness. Syncope results when the drop in BP impairs cerebral perfusion. Other manifestations of impaired baroreflexes are supine hypertension, a heart rate that is fixed regardless of posture, postprandial hypotension, and an excessively high nocturnal BP. Many patients with OH have a", "cold pressor test. In normal persons, immersing one hand in ice water for 1 to 5 min raises the systolic pressure by 15 to 20 mm Hg and the diastolic pressure by 10 to 15 mm Hg. Similarly, the sustained isometric contraction of a group of muscles (e.g., those of the forearm in handgrip) for 5 min normally increases the heart rate and the systolic and diastolic pressures by at least 15 mm Hg. The response in both of these tests is reduced or absent with lesions of the sympathetic reflex arc, particularly of the efferent limb, but neither of these tests has been well quantitated or validated. The stress involved in doing mental arithmetic in noisy and distracting surroundings will also stimulate a mild but measurable increase", "and gluconeogenesis as well as a diminished shivering response. In acute myocardial infarction associated with low cardiac output, hypothermia may be reversed after adequate resuscitation. With extensive burns, psoriasis, erythrodermas, and other skin diseases, increased peripheral-blood flow leads to excessive heat loss. Heat loss occurs through five mechanisms: radiation (55\u201365% of heat loss), conduction (10\u201315% of heat loss, much increased in cold water), convection (increased in the wind), respiration, and evaporation; both of the latter two mechanisms are affected by the ambient temperature and the relative humidity.

During periods of prolonged muscle activity, rephosphorylation requires the availability of carbohydrates, fatty acids, and ketones, which are catabolized in mitochondria. Glycogen is the main sarcoplasmic source of carbohydrate, but blood glucose also moves freely in and out of muscle cells as needed during sustained exercise. The fatty acids in the blood, derived mainly from adipose tissue and intracellular lipid stores, constitute the other major source of energy.

This decay represents the rapid and almost total failure of the fast motor units. The decline in force/stress is paralleled by depletion of glycogen and creatine phosphate stores and the accumulation of lactic acid. Of importance is that the decline in force/ stress occurs when the ATP pool is not greatly reduced, so that the muscle fibers do not go into rigor. In contrast, the slow motor units are able to meet the energy demands of fibers under this condition, and they do not exhibit significant fatigue, even after many hours.

Additionally the hematocrit increases slightly to enhance O2-carrying capacity. This increase results from stimulation of erythropoietin production by the kidney. Normal function of skeletal muscles also requires optimal amounts of thyroid hormone. This requirement may be related to regulation of energy production and storage. Glycolysis and glycogenolysis are increased, whereas glycogen and creatine phosphate are reduced by thyroid hormone excess. The inability of muscle to take up and phosphorylate creatine leads to its increased urinary excretion.

Because hypoxemia at rest is not always present and because severe exercise-induced hypoxemia may go undetected, it is useful to perform exercise testing with measurement of arterial blood gases to detect abnormalities of gas exchange. Arterial oxygen desaturation, a failure to decrease dead space appropriately with exercise (i.e., a high Vd/Vt [dead space/tidal volume] ratio [Chap. 306e]), and an excessive increase in respiratory rate with a lower than expected recruitment of tidal volume provide useful information about physiologic abnormalities and extent of disease.

It is unlikely that oxygenation of venous blood alters its K+ or phosphate content or its osmolarity and thereby neutralizes its vasodilator effect.

Although hepatic glycogen stores are usually sufficient to maintain plasma glucose levels for \u223c8 h, this period can be shorter if glucose demand is increased by exercise or if glycogen stores are depleted by illness or starvation. Gluconeogenesis normally requires low insulin levels and the presence of anti-insulin (counterregulatory) hormones together with a coordinated supply of precursors from muscle and adipose tissue to the liver (and kidneys). Muscle provides lactate, pyruvate, alanine, glutamine, and other amino acids. Triglycerides in adipose tissue are broken down into fatty acids and glycerol, which is a gluconeogenic precursor. Fatty acids provide an alternative oxidative fuel to tissues other than the brain (which requires glucose). Systemic glucose balance\u2014maintenance of the normal plasma glucose", "precursors are molecules that can be used to produce a net synthesis of glucose. The most important gluconeogenic precursors are glycerol, lactate, and \u03b1-keto acids obtained from the metabolism of glucogenic amino acids. [Note: All but two amino acids (leucine and lysine) are glucogenic (see p. 262).] A. Glycerol Glycerol is released during the hydrolysis of triacylglycerols (TAG) in adipose tissue (see p. 190) and is delivered by the blood to the liver. Glycerol is phosphorylated by glycerol kinase to glycerol 3-phosphate, B. Lactate Lactate from anaerobic glycolysis is released into the blood by exercising skeletal muscle and by cells that lack mitochondria such as RBC. In the Cori cycle, this lactate is taken up by the liver and oxidized to pyruvate that is converted to glucose, which", "degradation of TAG, glycogen, and protein. This sets into motion an exchange of substrates among the liver, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and brain that is guided by two priorities: 1) the need to maintain adequate plasma levels of glucose to sustain energy metabolism in the brain, red blood cells, and other glucose-requiring tissues and 2) the need to mobilize FA from TAG in WAT for the synthesis and release of ketone bodies by the liver to supply energy to other tissues and spare body protein. As a result, blood glucose levels are maintained within a narrow range in fasting, while FA and ketone body levels increase. [Note: Maintaining glucose requires that the substrates for gluconeogenesis (such as pyruvate, alanine, and glycerol) be available.] A. Fuel stores The metabolic", "from liver glycogen. Similarly, muscle glycogen is extensively degraded in exercising muscle to provide that tissue with an important energy source. When glycogen stores are depleted, specific tissues synthesize glucose de novo, using glycerol, lactate, pyruvate, and amino acids as carbon sources for gluconeogenesis (see Chapter 10). Figure 11.1 shows the reactions of glycogen synthesis and degradation as part of the essential pathways of energy metabolism. II. STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION The main stores of glycogen are found in skeletal muscle and liver, although most other cells store small amounts of glycogen for their own use. The function of muscle glycogen is to serve as a fuel reserve for the synthesis of ATP during muscle contraction. That of liver glycogen is to maintain the blood glucose concentration, particularly during", "during the interdigestive and fasting phases as opposed to \u201con a full stomach\u201d), although much of this lactate is utilized by aerobic skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle during exercise. But additionally the overall anabolism of the digestive phase switches over to a general catabolism during the fasting phase (see Fig. 39.3B ). TGs within adipocytes undergo lipolysis to FFAs and glycerol, and there is a general net proteolysis with the release of AAs during the fasting state. The glycerol and gluconeogenic AAs are released from cells and circulate to the liver, where they are subsequently used for gluconeogenesis. Thus gluconeogenesis requires an integration of catabolic pathways in adipocytes and skeletal myocytes with anabolic gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes. Gluconeogenesis eventually supplants glycogenolysis and can continue as long as precursors flow", "by hepatic gluconeogenesis from glucogenic precursors, such as amino acids from proteolysis and glycerol from lipolysis. In prolonged fasting (beyond 2\u20133 weeks), plasma ketone bodies (see Fig. 24.12) reach significantly elevated levels and replace glucose as the primary fuel for the brain (see Figs. 24.16, and 24.17). This reduces the need for protein catabolism for gluconeogenesis: Ketone bodies spare glucose and, thus, muscle protein. [Note: As the duration of a fast extends from overnight to days to weeks, blood glucose levels initially drop and then are maintained at the lower level (65\u201370 mg/dl).] The metabolic changes that occur during fasting insure that all tissues have an adequate supply of fuel molecules. The response of the major tissues involved in energy metabolism during fasting is summarized in Figure 24.18.", "glucose sparing depends on catabolic adipocyte metabolism, which results in lipolysis of stored TGs and release of FFAs. FFAs are imported by hepatocytes, which use FFAs to produce acetyl CoA. Protein degradation in available for ketogenesis. High levels of intramitochondrial acetyl CoA in the hepatocyte not only provides ample carbons for ATP synthesis but serves to: (1) inhibit conver sion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, (2) promote conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate for gluconeogenesis, and (3) promote synthesis of KBs (see Fig. 39.3B ). After several days of fasting, the CNS can start using KBs for energy, thereby further sparing glucose for erythrocytes. Many other cell types with mitochondria use KBs along with FFAs for ATP production, especially skeletal muscle. The hormones that drive glycogenolysis, gluconeogen esis, lipogenesis,", "produced by the catabolism of BCAA (see p. 267). The glutamine is used as a fuel by enterocytes, for example, which send out alanine that is used in hepatic gluconeogenesis (glucose\u2013alanine cycle)]. In the second week of fasting, the rate of muscle proteolysis decreases, paralleling a decline in the need for glucose as a fuel for the brain, which has begun using ketone bodies as a source of energy. XI. BRAIN IN FASTING During the early days of fasting, the brain continues to use only glucose as a fuel (Fig. 24.16, ). Blood glucose is maintained by hepatic gluconeogenesis from glucogenic precursors, such as amino acids from proteolysis and glycerol from lipolysis. In prolonged fasting (beyond 2\u20133 weeks), plasma ketone bodies (see Fig. 24.12) reach significantly elevated levels", "for gluconeogenesis. Thus gluconeogenesis requires an integration of catabolic pathways in adipocytes and skeletal myocytes with anabolic gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes. Gluconeogenesis eventually supplants glycogenolysis and can continue as long as precursors flow into the liver. Glucose sparing represents the other general process that contributes to maintenance of adequate circulating glucose levels during the fasting phase. Glucose sparing means the switching of fuel utilization from glucose to a nongluconeogenic fuel in most cell types, but especially in skeletal muscle, which represents the potentially largest single consumer of glucose. First, the uptake of glucose by skeletal muscle and adipocytes is greatly reduced because the GLUT4 transporter isoform exists in an intracellular CHAPTER 39 Hormonal Regulation of Energy Metabolism Fig. 39.3B) during the fasting phase. Thus alternative fuels need to be", "glucose production (gluconeogenesis) in the liver. In the hypometabolic/starved state, protein breakdown for gluconeogenesis is minimized, especially as ketones derived from fatty acids become the substrate preferred by certain tissues. In the hypermetabolic/stress state, gluconeogenesis increases dramatically and in proportion to the degree of the insult to increase the supply of glucose (the major fuel of reparation). Glucose is the only fuel that can be utilized by hypoxemic tissues (anaerobic glycolysis), white blood cells, and newly generated fibroblasts. Infusions of glucose partially offset a negative energy balance but do not significantly suppress the high rates of gluconeogenesis in catabolic patients. Hence, adequate supplies of protein are needed to replace the amino acids used for this metabolic response.

This test allows an estimate of the maximal oxygen consumption (Vo ). A Vo <15 mL/(kg\u22c5min) predicts for a higher risk of postoperative complications.

Conversely, patients who can complete stage III of the Bruce exercise protocol and have a normal stress perfusion scan or negative stress echocardiographic evaluation are at very low risk for future coronary events. The finding of frequent episodes", "out disease adequately if it is not sufficiently sensitive. Thus, the largest change in diagnostic likelihood following a test result occurs when the clinician is most uncertain (i.e., pretest probability between 30% and 70%). For example, if a patient has a pretest probability for CAD of 50%, a positive exercise treadmill test will move the posttest probability to 80% and a positive exercise SPECT perfusion test will move it to 90% (Fig. 3-2). As presented above, Bayes\u2019 rule employs a number of important simplifications that should be considered. First, few tests have only positive or negative results, and many tests provide multiple outcomes (e.g., ST-segment depression and exercise duration with exercise testing). Although Bayes\u2019 rule can be adapted to this more detailed test result format, it is computationally", "probability of disease is about 95%. In contrast, exercise SPECT myocardial perfusion test is more accurate for CAD. For simplicity, assume that the finding of a reversible exercise-induced perfusion defect has both a sensitivity and a specificity of 90%, yielding a likelihood ratio for a positive test of 9.0 (0.90/ [1 \u2013 0.90]) (consistent with moderate discriminatory ability because it falls between 5 and 10). For the same 10% pretest probability patient, a positive test raises the probability of CAD to 50% (Fig. 3-2). However, despite the differences in posttest probabilities between these two tests (30% versus 50%), the more accurate test may not improve diagnostic likelihood enough to change patient management (e.g., decision to refer to cardiac catheterization) because the more accurate test has only moved the", "versus 50%), the more accurate test may not improve diagnostic likelihood enough to change patient management (e.g., decision to refer to cardiac catheterization) because the more accurate test has only moved the physician from being fairly certain that the patient did not have CAD to a 50:50 chance of disease. In a patient with a pretest probability of 80%, exercise SPECT test raises the posttest probability to 97% (compared with 95% for the exercise treadmill). Again, the more accurate test does not provide enough improvement in posttest confidence to alter management, and neither test has improved much on what was known from clinical data alone. In general, positive results with an accurate test (e.g., likelihood ratio positive 10) when the pretest probability is low (e.g., 20%) do not", "New York: McGraw-Hill, 1995. in different dosage regimens than those used for depression.

Many of the molecules in the aqueous environment of a cell necessarily fall into this category, including sugars, DNA, RNA, and most proteins. Hydrophobic (water-hating) molecules, by contrast, are uncharged and form few or no hydrogen bonds, and so do not dissolve in water. Hydrocarbons are an important example. In these molecules all of the H atoms are covalently linked to C atoms by a largely nonpolar bond; thus they cannot form effective hydrogen bonds to other molecules (see Panel 2\u20131, p. 90).

The AChR consists of five subunits (2\u03b1, 1\u03b2, 1\u03b4, and 1\u03b3 or \u03b5) arranged around a central pore. When ACh combines with the binding sites on the \u03b1 subunits of the AChR, the channel in the AChR opens, permitting the rapid entry of cations, chiefly sodium, which produces depolarization at the end-plate region of the muscle fiber.

However, if the end plate potential is large, the adjacent muscle membrane is depolarized, and an action potential will be propagated along the entire muscle fiber. Muscle contraction is then initiated by excitation-contraction coupling. The released acetylcholine is quickly removed from the end plate region by both diffusion and enzymatic destruction by the local acetylcholinesterase enzyme. At least two additional types of acetylcholine receptors are found within the neuromuscular apparatus. One type is located on the presynaptic motor axon terminal, and activation of these receptors mobilizes additional transmitter for subsequent release by moving more acetylcholine vesicles toward the synaptic membrane. The second type of receptor is found on extrajunctional cells and is not normally involved in", "nicotinic blocking drugs.) When a nicotinic agonist is applied directly (by iontophoresis or by intra-arterial injection), an immediate depolarization of the end plate results, caused by an increase in permeability to sodium and potassium ions (Figure 7\u20134B). The contractile response varies from disorganized fasciculations of independent motor units to a strong contraction of the entire muscle depending on the synchronization of depolarization of end plates throughout the muscle. Depolarizing nicotinic agents that are not rapidly hydrolyzed (like nicotine itself) cause rapid development of depolarization blockade; transmission blockade persists even when the membrane has repolarized (discussed further in Chapters 8 and 27). This latter phase of block is manifested as flaccid paralysis in the case of skeletal muscle.

If the depolarization is sufficiently large, it initiates an action potential that is propagated along the muscle fiber, triggering muscle contraction.

In MG, the fundamental defect is a decrease in the number of available AChRs at the postsynaptic muscle membrane. In addition, the postsynaptic folds are flattened, or \u201csimplified.\u201d These changes result in decreased efficiency of neuromuscular transmission. Therefore, although ACh is released normally, it produces small end-plate potentials that may fail to trigger muscle action potentials. Failure of transmission at many neuromuscular junctions results in weakness of muscle", "receptors mobilizes additional transmitter for subsequent release by moving more acetylcholine vesicles toward the synaptic membrane. The second type of receptor is found on extrajunctional cells and is not normally involved in neuromuscular transmission. However, under certain conditions (eg, prolonged immobilization, thermal burns), these receptors may proliferate sufficiently to affect subsequent neuromuscular transmission. This proliferation of extrajunctional acetylcholine receptors may be clinically relevant when using depolarizing or nondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxant drugs and is described later. Skeletal muscle relaxation and paralysis can occur from interruption of function at several sites along the pathway from the CNS to myelinated somatic nerves, unmyelinated motor nerve terminals, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, the motor end plate, the muscle membrane, and the intracellular muscular contractile apparatus itself.

This influx results in a localized membrane depolariza tion, which in turn leads to the events described above. An enzyme called acetylcholinesterase (AChE) quickly breaks down the acetylcholine to prevent continued stimulation. For more detail description of ACh function, see Chapter 12.

These cytoplasmic organelles are believed to be involved in the synthesis of", "Continued agonist occupancy is associated with return of membrane voltage to the resting level.

Blockade of end plate function can be accomplished by two basic mechanisms. First, pharmacologic blockade of the physiologic agonist acetylcholine is characteristic of the antagonist neuromuscular blocking drugs (ie, nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs). These drugs prevent access of the transmitter to its receptor and thereby prevent depolarization. The prototype of this nondepolarizing subgroup is d-tubocurarine. The second mechanism of blockade can be produced by an excess of a depolarizing agonist, such as acetylcholine. This seemingly paradoxical effect of acetylcholine also occurs at the ganglionic nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. The prototypical depolarizing blocking drug is succinylcholine.

This period is called the relative refractory period. Early in the relative refractory period, before the CHAPTER 5 Generation and Conduction of Action Potentials membrane potential has returned to the resting potential level, some Na+ channels are still voltage inactivated, but there are enough in the closed state (and therefore have the potential to open when the membrane is depolarized) to support the generation of an action potential if they are stimulated to open. However, a stimulus stronger than normal is necessary to recruit the critical number of Na+ channels needed to trigger an action potential (i.e., the reduction in the total number of available Na+ channels is countered by increasing the probability of opening). Throughout the relative", "of the membrane, which will determine how far and how rapidly electrical signals at one point in the cell spread to other parts. The Local Response With regard to the experiment shown in Fig. 5.1, if larger depolarizing current pulses are injected, the voltage response of the membrane no longer resembles that of a passive RC circuit. This is most easily observed with pulses that elicit depolarizations either just below or to the threshold membrane potential for an action potential but fail to evoke an action potential (tracings 0.89 and 1.0; the threshold membrane potential can be defined as the voltage at which the probability of evoking an action potential is 50%).

Because these local currents shift the potential of the resting zone toward the threshold value, they are local stimuli that depolarize the adjacent resting portion of the fiber to its threshold potential. The greater the potential difference between the depolarized and polarized regions (i.e., the greater the action potential amplitude), the more effectively local stimuli can depolarize adjacent parts of the membrane, and the more rapidly the wave of depolarization is propagated down the fiber. The dVm/dt during phase 0 is also an important determinant of conduction velocity. If the active portion of the fiber depolarizes gradually, the local currents between the resting region and the neighboring depolarizing region are small.

Action potentials are the direct consequence of the properties of voltage-gated cation channels, as we now discuss. The plasma membrane of all electrically excitable cells\u2014not only neurons, but also muscle, endocrine, and egg cells\u2014contains voltage-gated cation channels, which are responsible for generating the action potentials. An action potential is triggered by a depolarization of the plasma membrane\u2014that is, by a shift in the membrane potential to a less negative value inside. (We shall see later how the action of a neurotransmitter causes depolarization.) In nerve and skeletal muscle cells, a stimulus that causes sufficient depolarization promptly opens the voltage-gated Na+ channels, allowing a small amount of Na+ to enter the cell down its electrochemical gradient.

(B) Three current records from three experiments performed on the same patch of membrane. Each major current step in (B) represents the opening and closing of a single channel. A comparison of the three records shows that, whereas the durations of channel opening and closing vary greatly, the rate at which current flows through an open channel (its conductance) is practically constant. The minor fluctuations in the current records arise largely from electrical noise in the recording apparatus.

Two such classes of responses are action potentials and synaptic potentials, which are described in this chapter and the next, respectively. Current knowledge about the ionic mechanisms of action potentials comes from experiments with many species. One of the most studied is the squid because the large diameter (up to 0.5 mm) of the squid giant axon makes it an excellent model for electrophysiological research with intracellular electrodes. The Passive Response To understand how an action potential is generated and why it is needed, it is necessary to understand the passive electrical properties of the nerve cell membrane.

A comparison of (B) and (C) reveals that the time course of the aggregate current reflects the probability that any individual channel will be in the open state; this probability decreases with time as the channels in the depolarized membrane adopt their inactivated conformation.

However, while the cell is receiving a burst of repetitive stimulation via one set of synapses, if a single action potential is delivered at another synapse on its surface, that latter synapse also will undergo LTP, even though a single action potential delivered there at another time would leave no such lasting trace. The underlying rule in such events seems to be that LTP occurs on any occasion when a presynaptic cell fires (once or more) at a time when the postsynaptic membrane is strongly depolarized (either through recent repetitive firing of the same presynaptic cell or by other means).

Glycolysis is at the hub of carbohydrate metabolism because virtually all sugars, whether arising from the diet or from catabolic reactions in the body, can ultimately be converted to glucose (Fig. 8.9A). Pyruvate is the end product of glycolysis in cells with mitochondria and an adequate supply of O2. This series of ten reactions is called aerobic glycolysis because O2 is required to reoxidize the NADH formed during the oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (Fig. 8.9B). Aerobic glycolysis sets the stage for the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, a major fuel of the TCA cycle. Alternatively, pyruvate is reduced to lactate as NADH is oxidized to NAD+ (Fig. 8.9C). This conversion of glucose to lactate is called anaerobic", "and activates pyruvate carboxylase, pushing pyruvate to gluconeogenesis and away from oxidation.

Glucose is the greatly preferred energy source for the brain and the required energy source for cells with few or no mitochondria such as mature red blood cells. Glucose is also essential as an energy source for exercising muscle, where it is the substrate for anaerobic glycolysis. Blood glucose can be obtained from three primary sources: the diet, glycogen degradation, and gluconeogenesis. Dietary intake of glucose and glucose precursors, such as starch (a polysaccharide), disaccharides, and monosaccharides, is sporadic and, depending on the diet, is not always a reliable source", "glycolysis and glycogenesis (pathways that promote glucose storage) are being stimulated in the liver in the absorptive state, gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis (pathways that generate glucose) are being inhibited. Pyruvate carboxylase (PC), which catalyzes the first step in gluconeogenesis, is largely inactive because of low levels of acetyl CoA, its allosteric activator (see p. 119). [Note: The acetyl CoA is being used for FA synthesis.] The high insulin/glucagon ratio also favors inactivation of other gluconeogenic enzymes such as fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (see Fig. 8.17, p. 100). Glycogenolysis is inhibited by dephosphorylation of glycogen phosphorylase and phosphorylase kinase. [Note: The increased uptake and decreased production of blood glucose in the absorptive period prevents hyperglycemia.] B. Fat metabolism 1. Increased fatty acid synthesis: Liver is the primary site of de novo synthesis", "to maintain the reactions of glycolysis (Figure 2\u201347).

Because two molecules of aTp are hydrolyzed in the early, energy-investment phase, glycolysis results in the net synthesis of 2 aTp and 2 naDh", "A (CoA) and compounds that give rise only to acetyl CoA (for example, acetoacetate, lysine, and leucine) cannot give rise to a net synthesis of glucose. This is because of the irreversible nature of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC), which converts pyruvate to acetyl CoA (see p. 109). These compounds give rise instead to ketone bodies (see p. 195) and are termed ketogenic.] III. REACTIONS Seven glycolytic reactions are reversible and are used in the synthesis of glucose from lactate or pyruvate. However, three glycolytic reactions are irreversible and must be circumvented by four alternate reactions that energetically favor the synthesis of glucose. These irreversible reactions, which together are unique to gluconeogenesis, are described below. A. Pyruvate carboxylation The first roadblock to overcome in the synthesis of glucose", "from liver glycogen. Similarly, muscle glycogen is extensively degraded in exercising muscle to provide that tissue with an important energy source. When glycogen stores are depleted, specific tissues synthesize glucose de novo, using glycerol, lactate, pyruvate, and amino acids as carbon sources for gluconeogenesis (see Chapter 10). Figure 11.1 shows the reactions of glycogen synthesis and degradation as part of the essential pathways of energy metabolism. II. STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION The main stores of glycogen are found in skeletal muscle and liver, although most other cells store small amounts of glycogen for their own use. The function of muscle glycogen is to serve as a fuel reserve for the synthesis of ATP during muscle contraction. That of liver glycogen is to maintain the blood glucose concentration, particularly during", "(30 mmol/100 g of tissue), mostly in the form of glycogen. Because glucose is utilized by the brain at a rate of 60 to 80 mg/min, the glucose reserve may sustain cerebral activity for 30 min or less once blood glucose is no longer available. Glucose is transported from the blood to the brain by an active carrier system. Glucose entering the brain either undergoes glycolysis or is stored as glycogen. During normal oxygenation (aerobic metabolism), glucose is converted to pyruvate, which enters the Krebs cycle; with anaerobic metabolism, lactate is formed. The oxidation of 1 mole of glucose requires 6 mole of O2. Of the glucose taken up by the brain, 85 to 90 percent is oxidized; the remainder is used in the formation of proteins and", "that the changes in fasting are the reciprocal of those in the fed state is helpful in understanding the ebb and flow of metabolism. VIII. LIVER IN FASTING The primary role of the liver in fasting is maintenance of blood glucose through the production of glucose (from glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis) for glucose-requiring tissues and the synthesis and distribution of ketone bodies for use by other tissues. Therefore, hepatic metabolism is distinguished from peripheral (or extrahepatic) metabolism. A. Carbohydrate metabolism The liver first uses glycogen degradation and then gluconeogenesis to maintain blood glucose levels to sustain energy metabolism of the brain and other glucose-requiring tissues in the fasted state. [Note: Recall that the presence of glucose-6-phosphatase in the liver allows the production of free glucose both from glycogenolysis and", "the carbon in the glucose they take up to CO2, which is lost from the body as a waste product. A growing tumor needs nutrients in abundance to provide the building blocks to make new macromolecules. Correspondingly, most tumors have a metabolism more similar to that of a growing embryo than to that of normal adult tissue. Tumor cells consume glucose avidly, importing it from the blood at a rate that can be as much as 100 times higher than neighboring normal cells. Moreover, only a small fraction of this imported glucose is used for production of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. Instead, a great deal of lactate is produced, and many of the remaining carbon atoms derived from glucose are diverted for use as raw materials for synthesis", "example, the addition of lactate to the blood that perfuses a heart metabolizing glucose leads to a reduction in glucose uptake and vice versa. At normal blood concentrations, glucose and lactate are consumed at approximately equal rates. In contrast, uptake of pyruvate is very low, as is its arterial concentration. For glucose, the threshold concentration is approximately 4 mmol/L. Below this blood level, no glucose is taken up by the myocardium. Insulin reduces the glucose threshold and increases the rate of glucose uptake by the heart. Cardiac utilization of lactate occurs in most circumstances; insulin does not affect its uptake by the myocardium. Under hypoxic conditions, glucose utilization is facilitated by an increase in the rate of transport across the myocardial cell wall. However, lactate cannot be metabolized"]}, {"id": "seed_task_9999", "name": "MMLU_test_collegemedicine", "is_classification": true, "instruction": "In this task, you are given a question and four different answer options.

When the energy demands of an exercising muscle cannot be met by oxidative metabolism, an oxygen debt is incurred.

Any intervention that results in inadequate O2 supply prompts the formation of vasodilator metabolites that are released from the tissue and act locally to dilate the resistance vessels. When the metabolic rate of the tissue increases, or when O2 delivery to the tissue decreases, more vasodilator substances are released (see Chapter 17).

This decay represents the rapid and almost total failure of the fast motor units. The decline in force/stress is paralleled by depletion of glycogen and creatine phosphate stores and the accumulation of lactic acid. Of importance is that the decline in force/ stress occurs when the ATP pool is not greatly reduced, so that the muscle fibers do not go into rigor.

However, release of K+ is not sustained, but arteriolar dilation persists throughout the period of enhanced muscle activity. Furthermore, reoxygenated venous blood obtained from active cardiac and skeletal muscles does not elicit vasodilation when the blood is infused into a test vascular bed. It is unlikely that oxygenation of venous blood alters its K+ or phosphate content or its osmolarity and thereby neutralizes its vasodilator effect. Therefore, some agent other than K+ must mediate the vasodilation associated with metabolic activity of the tissue.

In this experiment, purified myosin heads were attached to a glass slide, and then actin filaments labeled with fluorescent phalloidin were added and allowed to bind to the myosin heads. (A) When ATP was added, the actin filaments began to glide along the surface, owing to the many individual steps taken by each of the dozens of myosin heads bound to each filament.

In fortuitous sections, they exhibit a branching configuration consistent with a three-dimensional anastomosing network that extends from the sarcolemma into the interior of the cell (see Fig. 11.20).

Second, if the spindle were to become unloaded during the movement, this would oppose the intended movement by decreasing the excitatory drive, via the group Ia reflex arc (see next section), to the \u03b1 motor neurons driving the agonist muscles. As mentioned earlier, there are two types of \u03b3 motor neurons: dynamic and static (see Fig. 9.2). This allows the CNS to have very precise control over the sensitivity of the muscle spindle.

Postsynaptic Regulation Postsynaptic regulation can be considered from two perspectives: modulation by previous activity at the primary receptor (which may upor down-regulate receptor number or desensitize receptors; see Chapter 2), and modulation by other simultaneous events. The first mechanism has been well documented in several receptor-effector systems. Up-regulation and down-regulation are known to occur in response to decreased or increased activation, respectively, of the receptors. An extreme form of up-regulation occurs after denervation of some tissues, resulting in denervation supersensitivity of the tissue to activators of that receptor type.

Two carbons enter the cycle as acetyl CoA and two leave as CO2. Therefore, the entry of one acetyl CoA into one round of the TCA cycle does not lead to the net production or consumption of intermediates. A. Acetyl CoA production The major source of acetyl CoA for the TCA cycle is the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate by the multienzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH complex, or PDHC). However, the PDHC (described below) is not a component of the TCA cycle. Pyruvate, the end product of aerobic glycolysis, is transported from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix by the pyruvate mitochondrial carrier of the inner mitochondrial membrane. In the matrix,", "high and insulin is low (for example, as seen in fasting or diabetes). VII. ALTERNATE FATES OF PYRUVATE Pyruvate can be metabolized to products other than lactate. A. Oxidative decarboxylation to acetyl CoA Oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate by the PDHC is an important pathway in tissues with a high oxidative capacity such as cardiac muscle (Fig. 8.24). PDHC irreversibly converts pyruvate, the end product of aerobic glycolysis, into acetyl CoA, a TCA cycle substrate (see p. 109) and the carbon source for fatty acid synthesis (see p. 183). B. Carboxylation to oxaloacetate Carboxylation of pyruvate to oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase is a biotin-dependent reaction (see Fig. 8.24). This irreversible reaction is important because it replenishes the TCA cycle intermediate and provides substrate for gluconeogenesis (see p. 118). C.", "step 6 begins the energy-generation phase of glycolysis. Because two molecules of aTp are hydrolyzed in the early, energy-investment phase, glycolysis results in the net synthesis of 2 aTp and 2 naDh molecules per molecule of glucose (see also panel 2\u20138). Figure 2\u201347 Two pathways for the anaerobic breakdown of pyruvate. (a) When there is inadequate oxygen, for example, in a muscle cell undergoing vigorous contraction, the pyruvate produced by glycolysis is converted to lactate as shown. This reaction regenerates the naD+ consumed in step 6 of glycolysis, but the whole pathway yields much less energy overall than complete oxidation. (B) in some organisms that can grow anaerobically, such as yeasts, pyruvate is C regeneration C converted via acetaldehyde into carbon dioxide and ethanol. again, this pathway CO", "muscle and by cells that lack mitochondria such as RBC. In the Cori cycle, this lactate is taken up by the liver and oxidized to pyruvate that is converted to glucose, which is released back into the circulation (Fig. 10.2). C. Amino acids Amino acids produced by hydrolysis of tissue proteins are the major sources of glucose during a fast. Their metabolism generates \u03b1-keto acids, such as pyruvate that is converted to glucose, or \u03b1-ketoglutarate that can enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and form oxaloacetate (OAA), a direct precursor of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). [Note: Acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) and compounds that give rise only to acetyl CoA (for example, acetoacetate, lysine, and leucine) cannot give rise to a net synthesis of glucose. This is because of the irreversible", "the use of different start sites in transcription (see p. 473) of the gene that encodes the enzyme. K. Pyruvate reduction to lactate Lactate, formed from pyruvate by LDH, is the final product of anaerobic glycolysis in eukaryotic cells (Fig. 8.21). Reduction to lactate is the major fate for pyruvate in tissues that are poorly vascularized (for example, the lens and cornea of the eye and the kidney medulla) or in RBC that lack mitochondria. 1. Lactate formation in muscle: In exercising skeletal muscle, NADH production (by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and by the three NAD+-linked dehydrogenases of the TCA cycle, see p. 113) exceeds the oxidative capacity of the ETC. This results in an elevated NADH/NAD+ ratio, favoring reduction of pyruvate to lactate by LDH. Therefore, during intense", "diameter, and each requires a different enzyme. As is clear from Figure 2\u201363, the same molecule can often be part of many different pathways. Pyruvate, for example, is a substrate for half a dozen or more different enzymes, each of which modifies it chemically in a different way. One enzyme converts pyruvate to acetyl CoA, another to oxaloacetate; a third enzyme changes pyruvate to the amino acid alanine, a fourth to lactate, and so on. All of these different pathways compete for the same pyruvate molecule, and similar competitions for thousands of other small molecules go on at the same time. The situation is further complicated in a multicellular organism. Different cell types will in general require somewhat different sets of enzymes. And different tissues make distinct contributions", "A (CoA) and compounds that give rise only to acetyl CoA (for example, acetoacetate, lysine, and leucine) cannot give rise to a net synthesis of glucose. This is because of the irreversible nature of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC), which converts pyruvate to acetyl CoA (see p. 109). These compounds give rise instead to ketone bodies (see p. 195) and are termed ketogenic.] III. REACTIONS Seven glycolytic reactions are reversible and are used in the synthesis of glucose from lactate or pyruvate. However, three glycolytic reactions are irreversible and must be circumvented by four alternate reactions that energetically favor the synthesis of glucose. These irreversible reactions, which together are unique to gluconeogenesis, are described below. A. Pyruvate carboxylation The first roadblock to overcome in the synthesis of glucose", "poor perfusion. Lactic acidosis also occurs when specific reactions of pyruvate are impaired. In the liver, pyruvate undergoes carboxylation to form oxaloacetate using the enzyme pyruvate carboxylase; deficiency in this enzyme causes severe lactic acidosis. In many tissues, lactate is catabolized to form acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; deficiency in pyruvate dehydrogenase also can cause lactic acidosis. Because these reactions also play a role in gluconeogenesis, hypoglycemia can be a feature of these disorders. These disorders comprise forms of primary lactic acidosis. They frequently present as intractable, lethal acidosis in the first days or weeks of life and are difficult to treat. Some of the enzymes in this pathway can be measured Figure 57-2 Metabolism of pyruvate and lactate. (1) Alanine aminotransferase, (2) lactate", "days or weeks of life and are difficult to treat.

Mitochondrial function is carried out by proteins that are coded for by both nuclear and mitochondrial genes. These enzymes are extremely complicated, and several are quite large.

Blood glucose yields 36 mol of ATP per mole of glucose because 1 ATP is used to phosphorylate glucose at the start of glycolysis. These ATP yields, however, are dependent on an adequate oxygen supply. Under anaerobic conditions, in contrast, metabolism of glycogen and glucose yields only 3 and 2 mol of ATP per mole of glucose 1-phosphate and glucose, respectively (along with 2 mol of lactate). As discussed later, muscle fatigue during prolonged exercise is associated with depletion of glycogen stores in the muscle. Fatty acids represent an important source of energy for muscle", "most representative can be presented in a textbook of neurology. The Nature of Primary Metabolic Myopathies The chemical energy for muscle contraction is provided by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP); ATP is restored by phosphocreatine and ADP acting in combination. These reactions are particularly important during brief, high-intensity exercise. During periods of prolonged muscle activity, rephosphorylation requires the availability of carbohydrates, fatty acids, and ketones, which are catabolized in mitochondria. Glycogen is the main sarcoplasmic source of carbohydrate, but blood glucose also moves freely in and out of muscle cells as needed during sustained exercise. The fatty acids in the blood, derived mainly from adipose tissue and intracellular lipid stores, constitute the other major source of energy. Carbohydrate is metabolized during aerobic and", "the lactate generated by glycolysis. The increased cardiac and respiratory work during recovery also contributes to the increased oxygen consumption seen at this time and explains why more oxygen has to be \u201crepaid\u201d than was \u201cborrowed.\u201d Some oxygen debt occurs even with low levels of exercise because slow oxidative motor units consume considerable ATP, derived from creatine phosphate or glycolysis, before oxidative metabolism can increase ATP production to meet steady-state requirements. The oxygen debt is much greater with strenuous exercise, when fast glycolytic motor units are used (Fig. 12.18 ). The oxygen debt is approximately equal to the energy consumed during exercise minus that supplied by oxidative metabolism (i.e., the darkand light-colored areas in Fig. 12.18 are approximately equal). As indicated earlier, the additional oxygen used during recovery", "to maintain the reactions of glycolysis (Figure 2\u201347).

Because two molecules of aTp are hydrolyzed in the early, energy-investment phase, glycolysis results in the net synthesis of 2 aTp and 2 naDh", "the carbon in the glucose they take up to CO2, which is lost from the body as a waste product. A growing tumor needs nutrients in abundance to provide the building blocks to make new macromolecules. Correspondingly, most tumors have a metabolism more similar to that of a growing embryo than to that of normal adult tissue. Tumor cells consume glucose avidly, importing it from the blood at a rate that can be as much as 100 times higher than neighboring normal cells. Moreover, only a small fraction of this imported glucose is used for production of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. Instead, a great deal of lactate is produced, and many of the remaining carbon atoms derived from glucose are diverted for use as raw materials for synthesis", "Energy Production by Oxidative Metabolism. Upper panel, Energyexpenditureduringstrenuousexercise.Lower panel, Energyexpenditureduringenduranceexercise.Seetextfordetails. tetanic periods decays rapidly to a level that can be maintained for long periods ( Fig. 12.19 ). This decay represents the rapid and almost total failure of the fast motor units. The decline in force/stress is paralleled by depletion of glycogen and creatine phosphate stores and the accumulation of lactic acid. Of importance is that the decline in force/ stress occurs when the ATP pool is not greatly reduced, so that the muscle fibers do not go into rigor. In contrast, the slow motor units are able to meet the energy demands of fibers under this condition, and they do not exhibit significant fatigue, even after many hours. Evidently, some factor associated with energy metabolism can inhibit", "although the accumulation of various metabolic products (lactate, Pi, ADP) has been implicated. In view of the importance of preventing depletion of myoplasmic ATP, which would affect the viability of the cell, it is likely that multiple mechanisms may have been developed to induce fatigue and hence lower the rate of ATP hydrolysis before the individual risks injury or death of the skeletal muscle cell. 11. When the energy demands of an exercising muscle cannot be met by oxidative metabolism, an oxygen debt is incurred. Increased breathing during the recovery period after exercise reflects this oxygen debt. The greater the reliance on anaerobic metabolism to meet the energy requirements of muscle contraction, the greater the oxygen debt. Gordon AM, Homsher E, Regnier M.

Pyruvate kinase deficiency: Because mature RBC lack mitochondria, they are completely dependent on glycolysis for ATP production.

Most current methods of manipulating DNA, RNA, and proteins rely on prior knowledge of the nucleotide sequence of the genome of interest. But how were these sequences determined in the first place? And how are new DNA and RNA molecules sequenced today? In the late 1970s, researchers developed several strategies for determining, simply and quickly, the nucleotide sequence of any purified DNA fragment. The one that became the most widely used is called dideoxy sequencing or Sanger sequencing (Panel 8\u20131). This method was used to determine the nucleotide sequence of many genomes, including those of E. coli, fruit flies, nematode worms, mice, and humans.

Sequencing cloned DNA fragments The base sequence of DNA fragments that have been cloned can be determined. The original procedure for this purpose was the Sanger dideoxy chain termination method illustrated in Figure 34.9. In this method, the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to be sequenced is used as the template for DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase (DNA pol). A radiolabeled primer complementary to the 3\u2032-end of the target DNA is added, along with the four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTP). The sample is divided into four reaction tubes, and a small amount of one of the four dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (ddNTP) is added to each tube. Because it contains no 3\u2032-hydroxyl group, incorporation of a ddNMP terminates elongation at that point. The products of", "The immobilized DNA strands are prevented from self-annealing but are available for hybridization to the exogenous, radiolabeled, single-stranded probe. The extent of hybridization is measured by the retention of radioactivity on the membrane. Excess probe molecules that do not hybridize are removed by washing the membrane. B. Synthetic oligonucleotide probes If the sequence of all or part of the target DNA is known, short, single-stranded oligonucleotide probes can be synthesized that are complementary to a small region of the gene of interest. If the sequence of the gene is unknown, the amino acid sequence of the protein, the final gene product, may be used to construct a nucleic acid probe using the genetic code as a guide.

[Note: The genomes of several viruses, prokaryotes, and nonhuman eukaryotes have also been sequenced.] II.

The authors tend to agree with those who view intelligence as a general mental capability, embracing a number of primary abilities: the capacity to comprehend complex ideas, learn from experience, think abstractly, reason, plan, draw analogies, and solve problems. Thus intelligence includes a multiplicity of abilities, which probably accounts for a lack of consensus about its mechanism.

They suffer a developmental motor apraxia. This leads to a form of physical awkwardness that may be seen in the developmentally delayed child.

Differentiating clinically significant agoraphobic fears from reasonable fears (e.g., leaving the house dur- ing a bad storm) or from situations that are deemed dangerous (e.g., walking in a parking lot or using public transportation in a high-crime area) is important for a number of reasons. First, what constitutes avoidance may be difficult to judge across cultures and sociocultural contexts (e.g., it is socioculturally appropriate for orthodox Muslim women in certain parts of the world to avoid leaving the house alone, and thus such avoidance would not be con- sidered indicative of agoraphobia).

The development of energy beyond major cities has enabled wealthier communities to imagine, and indeed, to expect healthcare to be available at all times and affordable.

Communication and transportation technologies, for example, the mobile phone and air and ground travel, have dramatically progressed in highand middle-income countries but are still rudimentary in poor countries.

This exposure elicits mild hyperthermia \u2013 an increase in the body's core temperature \u2013 that induces a thermoregulatory response involving neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, and cytoprotective mechanisms that work together to restore homeostasis and condition the body for future heat stressors\u2026 In recent decades, sauna bathing has emerged as a means to increase lifespan and improve overall health, based on compelling data from observational, interventional, and mechanistic studies. Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week\u2026 The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)\u2026Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F, or normal) to 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and then rapidly increasing to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F)\u2026  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance\u2026 Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors\u2026 The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise.

PART 2 Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseases Although most patients with elevated body temperature have fever, there are circumstances in which elevated temperature represents not fever but hyperthermia (heat stroke). Hyperthermia is characterized by an uncontrolled increase in body temperature that exceeds the body\u2019s ability to lose heat. The setting of the hypothalamic thermoregulatory center is unchanged. In contrast to fever in infections, hyperthermia does not involve pyrogenic molecules. Exogenous heat exposure and endogenous heat production are two mechanisms by which hyperthermia can result in dangerously high internal temperatures. Excessive heat production can easily cause hyperthermia despite physiologic and behavioral control of body temperature. For example, work or exercise in hot environments can produce heat faster than peripheral mechanisms can lose it.", "The immediate defense of thermoneutrality is via the autonomic nervous system, whereas delayed control is mediated by the endocrine system. Autonomic nervous system responses include the release of norepinephrine, increased muscle tone, and shivering, leading to thermogenesis and an increase in the basal metabolic rate. Cutaneous cold thermoreception causes direct reflex vasoconstriction to conserve heat. Prolonged exposure to cold also stimulates the thyroid axis, leading to an increased metabolic rate. In most cases of hypothermia, the history of exposure to environmental factors (e.g., prolonged exposure to the outdoors without adequate clothing) makes the diagnosis straightforward. In urban settings, however, the presentation is often more subtle, and other disease processes, toxin exposures, or psychiatric diagnoses should be considered. After initial stimulation by hypothermia, there is progressive depression of all", "period of collapse, which is usually brief, equilibrium is spontaneously reestablished if the victim is able to rehydrate. Heat stroke is associated with high ambient temperatures and high humidity. Thermoregulatory mechanisms fail, sweating ceases, and core body temperature rises. In the clinical setting, a rectal temperature of 106\u00b0F or higher is considered a grave prognostic sign, and the mortality rate for such patients exceeds 50%. The underlying mechanism is marked generalized peripheral vasodilation with peripheral pooling of blood and a decreased effective circulating blood volume. Necrosis of the muscles and myocardium may occur. Arrhythmias, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and other systemic effects are common. Elderly people, persons with cardiovascular disease, and otherwise healthy people undergoing physical stress (such as young athletes and military recruits) are prime candidates for heat", "coagulation, and other systemic effects are common. Elderly people, persons with cardiovascular disease, and otherwise healthy people undergoing physical stress (such as young athletes and military recruits) are prime candidates for heat stroke. \u2022 Malignant hyperthermia, although similar sounding, is not caused by exposure to high temperatures. It is a genetic condition resulting from mutations in genes such as RYR1 that control calcium levels in skeletal muscle cells. In affected individuals, exposure to certain anesthetics during surgery may trigger a rapid rise in calcium levels in skeletal muscle, which in turn leads to muscle rigidity and increased heat production. The resulting hyperthermia has a mortality rate of approximately 80% if untreated, but this falls to less than 5% if the condition is recognized and muscle relaxants are administered", "ejection of blood by the left ventricle and diminished peripheral runoff during the brief ventricular ejection period (see also During exhaustive exercise, the compensatory mechanisms begin to fail. The heart rate attains a maximal level of approximately 180 beats per minute, and stroke volume reaches a plateau. The heart rate may then decrease, which results in a fall in blood pressure. The exercising individual also frequently becomes dehydrated. Sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity supersedes the vasodilator influence on vessels of the skin so that the rate of heat loss is decreased. Body temperature is normally elevated during exercise. A reduction in heat loss through cutaneous vasoconstriction can lead to very high body temperatures and to acute distress during severe exercise.

Lack of sweating after a hot bath, during exercise, or on a hot day can suggest sudomotor failure. OH (also called orthostatic or postural hypotension) is perhaps the most disabling feature of autonomic dysfunction. The prevalence of OH is relatively high, especially when OH associated with aging and diabetes mellitus is included (Table 454-4). OH can cause a variety of symptoms, including dimming or loss of vision, lightheadedness, diaphoresis, diminished hearing, pallor, and weakness. Syncope results when the drop in BP impairs cerebral perfusion. Other manifestations of impaired baroreflexes are supine hypertension, a heart rate that is fixed regardless of posture, postprandial hypotension, and an excessively high nocturnal BP. Many patients with OH have a", "cold pressor test. In normal persons, immersing one hand in ice water for 1 to 5 min raises the systolic pressure by 15 to 20 mm Hg and the diastolic pressure by 10 to 15 mm Hg. Similarly, the sustained isometric contraction of a group of muscles (e.g., those of the forearm in handgrip) for 5 min normally increases the heart rate and the systolic and diastolic pressures by at least 15 mm Hg. The response in both of these tests is reduced or absent with lesions of the sympathetic reflex arc, particularly of the efferent limb, but neither of these tests has been well quantitated or validated. The stress involved in doing mental arithmetic in noisy and distracting surroundings will also stimulate a mild but measurable increase", "and gluconeogenesis as well as a diminished shivering response. In acute myocardial infarction associated with low cardiac output, hypothermia may be reversed after adequate resuscitation. With extensive burns, psoriasis, erythrodermas, and other skin diseases, increased peripheral-blood flow leads to excessive heat loss. Heat loss occurs through five mechanisms: radiation (55\u201365% of heat loss), conduction (10\u201315% of heat loss, much increased in cold water), convection (increased in the wind), respiration, and evaporation; both of the latter two mechanisms are affected by the ambient temperature and the relative humidity.

The oxygen debt is much greater with strenuous exercise, when fast glycolytic motor units are used (Fig. 12.18 ). The oxygen debt is approximately equal to the energy consumed during exercise minus that supplied by oxidative metabolism (i.e., the darkand light-colored areas in Fig. 12.18 are approximately equal). As indicated earlier, the additional oxygen used during recovery", "of the TCA cycle, see p. 113) exceeds the oxidative capacity of the ETC. This results in an elevated NADH/NAD+ ratio, favoring reduction of pyruvate to lactate by LDH. Therefore, during intense exercise, lactate accumulates in muscle, causing a drop in the intracellular pH, potentially resulting in cramps. Much of this lactate eventually diffuses into the bloodstream and can be used by the liver to make glucose (see p. 118). 2. Lactate utilization: The direction of the LDH reaction depends on the relative intracellular concentrations of pyruvate and lactate and on the ratio of NADH/NAD+. For example, in the liver and heart, this ratio is lower than in exercising muscle. Consequently, the liver and heart oxidize lactate (obtained from the blood) to pyruvate. In the liver, pyruvate is", "glycogen, which are then metabolized by a combination of glycolysis (in the cytosol) and oxidative phosphorylation (in the mitochondria) to yield the equivalent of 37 mol of ATP per mole of glucose 1-phosphate. Blood glucose yields 36 mol of ATP per mole of glucose because 1 ATP is used to phosphorylate glucose at the start of glycolysis. These ATP yields, however, are dependent on an adequate oxygen supply. Under anaerobic conditions, in contrast, metabolism of glycogen and glucose yields only 3 and 2 mol of ATP per mole of glucose 1-phosphate and glucose, respectively (along with 2 mol of lactate). As discussed later, muscle fatigue during prolonged exercise is associated with depletion of glycogen stores in the muscle. Fatty acids represent an important source of energy for muscle", "aerobic exercise, blood flow to muscle and the availability of glucose and fatty acids are increased. At first, glucose is the main source of energy during exercise; later, with exhaustion of glycogen stores, energy is provided by oxidation of fatty acids. Thus, muscle failure at a certain phase of exercise is predictive of the type of energy failure. A rising blood concentration of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate reflects the increasing oxidation of fatty acids, and an increase in blood lactate reflects the anaerobic metabolism of glucose. The cytochrome oxidative mechanisms are essential in both aerobic and anaerobic muscle metabolism; these mechanisms are considered in Chap. 36 in relation to the mitochondrial diseases in which muscle tissue is prominently involved, and they are referred to here only briefly. It follows from these", "the use of different start sites in transcription (see p. 473) of the gene that encodes the enzyme. K. Pyruvate reduction to lactate Lactate, formed from pyruvate by LDH, is the final product of anaerobic glycolysis in eukaryotic cells (Fig. 8.21). Reduction to lactate is the major fate for pyruvate in tissues that are poorly vascularized (for example, the lens and cornea of the eye and the kidney medulla) or in RBC that lack mitochondria. 1. Lactate formation in muscle: In exercising skeletal muscle, NADH production (by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and by the three NAD+-linked dehydrogenases of the TCA cycle, see p. 113) exceeds the oxidative capacity of the ETC. This results in an elevated NADH/NAD+ ratio, favoring reduction of pyruvate to lactate by LDH. Therefore, during intense", "although the accumulation of various metabolic products (lactate, Pi, ADP) has been implicated. In view of the importance of preventing depletion of myoplasmic ATP, which would affect the viability of the cell, it is likely that multiple mechanisms may have been developed to induce fatigue and hence lower the rate of ATP hydrolysis before the individual risks injury or death of the skeletal muscle cell. 11. When the energy demands of an exercising muscle cannot be met by oxidative metabolism, an oxygen debt is incurred. Increased breathing during the recovery period after exercise reflects this oxygen debt. The greater the reliance on anaerobic metabolism to meet the energy requirements of muscle contraction, the greater the oxygen debt. Gordon AM, Homsher E, Regnier M.

This decay represents the rapid and almost total failure of the fast motor units. The decline in force/stress is paralleled by depletion of glycogen and creatine phosphate stores and the accumulation of lactic acid. Of importance is that the decline in force/ stress occurs when the ATP pool is not greatly reduced, so that the muscle fibers do not go into rigor. In contrast, the slow motor units are able to meet the energy demands of fibers under this condition, and they do not exhibit significant fatigue, even after many hours. Evidently, some factor associated with energy metabolism can inhibit", "climbing stairs. In others, rapidly progressive weakness became evident in infancy, with early death from respiratory failure. Curiously, these extreme forms are not directly related to severity of the enzyme deficiencies. The contracted muscles, unlike muscles in other involuntary spasms, no longer use energy and they are more or less electrically silent (i.e., no electrical activity is recorded from maximally contracted muscle during the cramps). Moreover, the muscle does not produce lactic acid. The shortened state is spoken of as physiologic contracture as discussed in the introductory sections of this chapter. Ischemia contributes to this condition by denying glucose to the muscle, which then cannot function adequately on fatty acids and nonglucose substrates.

Randomized clinical studies have shown that the combination of paclitaxel and cisplatin provides survival benefit compared with the previous standard combination of cisplatin plus cyclophosphamide. More recently, carboplatin plus paclitaxel has become the treatment of choice. In patients who present with recurrent disease, topotecan, altretamine, or liposomal doxorubicin are used as single-agent monotherapy. The introduction of platinum-based combination chemotherapy has made an impressive change in the treatment of patients with advanced testicular cancer. Presently, chemotherapy is recommended for patients with stage IIC or stage III seminomas and nonseminomatous disease. Over 90% of patients respond to chemotherapy and, depending upon the extent and severity of disease, complete remissions are observed in 70\u201380% of patients.

Advantages of thrombolytic therapy over balloon embolectomy include the reduced endothelial trauma and potential for more gradual and complete clot lysis in branch vessels usually too small to access by embolectomy balloons.

Hematogenous Candida endophthalmitis is a special problem requiring ophthalmologic consultation. When lesions are expanding or are threatening the macula, an IV polyene combined with flucytosine (25 mg/kg four times daily) has been the regimen of choice, although comparative studies with other regimens have not yet been reported.

In contrast, the multisubunit allosteric enzymes show a sigmoidal curve similar in shape to the oxygen-dissociation curve of hemoglobin. They typically catalyze the committed step of a pathway. Allosteric enzymes are regulated by molecules called effectors that bind noncovalently at a site other than the active site.

Statins, such as atorvastatin (Lipitor) and pravastatin (Pravachol), are structural analogs of the natural substrate for this enzyme and compete effectively to inhibit HMG CoA reductase.

This is identical to the situation in skeletal muscle; in smooth muscle, in contrast, contraction is thick filament regulated (see During a rise in intracellular [Ca++] and exposure of myosin-binding sites on actin, the myosin cross-bridges undergo a series of steps that result in contraction of", "Ca2 channels. During skeletal muscle depolarization, short activation of these sensors is not sufficient to open Ca2 channels. Thus, Ca2 transport from the lumen of the T tubule into the sarcoplasm does not occur and is not essential to trigger the contraction cycle. Instead, activation of these sensors opens gated Ca2-release channels in adjacent terminal sacs of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, causing the rapid release of Ca2 into the sarcoplasm. The increased concentration of Ca2 in the sarcoplasm initiates contraction of the myofibril by binding to the TnC portion of the troponin complex on the thin filaments (see page 316). The change in molecular conformation of TnC causes the TnI to dissociate from the actin molecules, allowing the troponin complex to uncover myosin-binding sites on the actin molecules. The", "can explain contraction in both striated and smooth muscle (see Fig. 11.22). As in striated muscle, contraction is initiated by an increase in the Ca2 concentration in the cytosol, but the contraction does not act through a troponin\u2013tropomyosin complex on the thin filament. Rather, in smooth muscle, an increase in Ca2 concentration stimulates a myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) to phosphorylate one of the two regulatory light chains of the myosin molecule. The Ca2 binds to calmodulin to form the Ca2\u2013calmodulin complex, which in turn binds to MLCK to activate the phosphorylation reaction of the regulatory light chain of myosin (Fig. 11.23). When the light chain is phosphorylated, the actin-binding site of the myosin head is activated and attaches to actin. In the presence of ATP, the myosin", "Therefore, even though the cross-bridges are energized, they cannot interact with actin. Step 2: When Ca2+ binding to troponin C has exposed active sites on the thin filament, actin interacts with the myosin cross-bridges to form an active complex (lower right) in which the energy derived from ATP is retained in the actin-bound cross-bridge, whose orientation has not yet shifted. Step 3: The muscle contracts when ADP dissociates from the cross-bridge. This step leads to the formation of the low-energy rigor complex (lower left) in which the chemical energy derived from ATP hydrolysis has been expended to perform mechanical work (the \u201crowing\u201d motion of the cross-bridge). Step 4: The muscle returns to its resting state, and the cycle ends when a new molecule of ATP binds to the", "change in the regulatory protein tropomyosin; the latter, in turn, exposes the actin cross-bridge interaction sites (Fig. 265e-5). Repetitive interaction between myosin heads and actin filaments is termed cross-bridge cycling, which results in sliding of the actin along the myosin filaments, ultimately causing muscle shortening and/or the development of tension. The splitting of ATP then dissociates the myosin cross-bridge from actin. In the presence of ATP (Fig. 265e-5), linkages between actin and myosin filaments are made and broken cyclically as long as sufficient Ca2+ is present; these linkages cease when [Ca2+] falls below a critical level, and the troponintropomyosin complex once more prevents interactions between the myosin cross-bridges and actin filaments (Fig. 265e-6). Intracytoplasmic Ca2+ is a principal determinant of the inotropic state of the heart. Most agents", "Disorders of the Cardiovascular System FIGURE 265e-5 Four steps in cardiac muscle contraction and relaxation. In relaxed muscle (upper left), ATP bound to the myosin cross-bridge dissociates the thick and thin filaments. Step 1: Hydrolysis of myosin-bound ATP by the ATPase site on the myosin head transfers the chemical energy of the nucleotide to the activated cross-bridge (upper right). When cytosolic Ca2+ concentration is low, as in relaxed muscle, the reaction cannot proceed because tropomyosin and the troponin complex on the thin filament do not allow the active sites on actin to interact with the cross-bridges. Therefore, even though the cross-bridges are energized, they cannot interact with actin. Step 2: When Ca2+ binding to troponin C has exposed active sites on the thin filament, actin interacts with the", "that involves binding of Ca++ to troponin C, followed by movement of tropomyosin toward the groove in the thin filament). Myosin cross-bridges then appear to undergo a ratchet action, with the thin filaments pulled toward the center of the sarcomere and contracting the skeletal muscle fiber. Relaxation of the muscle follows as myoplasmic Ca++ is resequestered by Ca++-ATPase (SERCA) in the SR. 4. The force of contraction can be increased by the activation of more motor neurons (i.e., recruiting of more muscle fibers) or by an increase in the frequency of action potentials in the muscle fiber, which produces tetany. The increase in force during tetanic contractions is due to prolonged elevation of intracellular [Ca++]. 5.

A high concentration of Ca2+-binding proteins in the ER facilitates Ca2+ storage. In some cell types, and perhaps in most, specific regions of the ER are specialized for Ca2+ storage. Muscle cells have an abundant, modified smooth ER called the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The release and reuptake of Ca2+ by the sarcoplasmic reticulum trigger myofibril contraction and relaxation, respectively, during each round of muscle contraction (discussed in Chapter 16). To study the functions and biochemistry of the ER, it is necessary to isolate", "Ca2+ pump, or Ca2+ ATPase, in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane of skeletal muscle cells is a well-understood P-type transport ATPase. The SR is a specialized type of endoplasmic reticulum that forms a network of tubular sacs in the muscle cell cytoplasm, and it serves as an intracellular store of Ca2+. When an action potential depolarizes the muscle cell plasma membrane, Ca2+ is released into the cytosol from the SR through Ca2+-release channels, stimulating the muscle to contract (discussed in Chapters 15 and 16). The Ca2+ pump, which accounts for about 90% of the membrane protein of the SR, moves Ca2+ from the cytosol back into the SR. The endoplasmic reticulum of nonmuscle cells contains a similar Ca2+ pump, but in smaller quantities. Enzymatic studies and analyses of", "are activated during a contraction, and so recruiting more muscle cells is not an option. Moreover, tetany of cardiac muscle cells would prevent any pumping action and thus be fatal. Consequently, the heart relies on different means of increasing the force of contraction, including varying the amplitude of the intracellular Ca++ transient. Relaxation of Cardiac Muscle Relaxation of skeletal muscle simply requires reaccumulation of Ca++ by the SR through the action of the sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase (SERCA), also known as the SR Ca++ pump. Although SERCA plays a key role in the decrease in cytosolic [Ca++] in cardiac muscle, the process is more complex than that in skeletal muscle because some trigger Ca++ enters the cardiac muscle cell through the sarcolemmal calcium channels during each action potential.", "release channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (see below). Calcium sparks directly augment intracellular calcium concentration and indirectly increase intracellular calcium concentration by activating chloride channels. In addition, calcium sparks reduce smooth-muscle contractility by activating large-conductance calcium-sensitive K+ channels, hyperpolarizing the cell membrane and thereby limiting further voltage-dependent increases in intracellular calcium. Biochemical agonists also increase intracellular calcium concentration, in this case by receptor-dependent activation of phospholipase C with hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, resulting in the generation of diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). These membrane lipid derivatives in turn activate protein kinase C and increase intracellular calcium concentration. In addition, IP3 binds to specific receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane to increase calcium efflux from this calcium storage pool into the cytoplasm. Vascular smooth-muscle cell contraction depends principally", "activate phospholipase C (PLC) (see ). PLC hydrolyzes the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) into InsP3 and diacylglycerol. InsP3 then diffuses to the SR and opens the InsP3-gated Ca++ channel, thereby resulting in release of Ca++ from the SR into the myoplasm. This complex process may permit graded release of Ca++ from the SR and also enable many different neurotransmitters and hormones to effect smooth muscle contraction. Calcium is reaccumulated by the SR through the activity of the SERCA, although as indicated later, extrusion of Ca++ from the smooth muscle cell also contributes to the reduction in myoplasmic [Ca++]. Refilling of the SR with Ca++ not only involves reaccumulation of cytosolic Ca++ but also depends on the extracellular [Ca++]. The dependence on extracellular [Ca++] is thought to reflect", "from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and thereby initiate a contraction-relaxation cycle.

Damage to the arousal system at the level of the rostral pons and lower midbrain causes coma, indicating that the ascending arousal influence from this level is critical in maintaining wakefulness. Damage to the hypothalamic branch of the arousal system causes profound sleepiness, but usually not coma. Specific loss of the orexin neurons produces the sleep disorder narcolepsy (see below).

Following the observations that the tricyclic antidepressants and the monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors exerted their effect by increasing norepinephrine and serotonin at central adrenergic receptor sites in the limbic system and hypothalamus and that depression-provoking drugs (such as reserpine) deplete biogenic amines at these sites, it was proposed that naturally occurring depressions might be associated with a deficiency of these substances.

A reduction in the primary serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in the cerebrospinal fluid is associated with violent and impulsive behavior, including violent suicide attempts.

CYCLE OVERVIEW The tricarboxylic acid cycle ([TCA cycle] also called the citric acid cycle, or the Krebs cycle) plays several roles in metabolism. It is the final pathway where the oxidative catabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, and fatty acids converge, their carbon skeletons being converted to carbon dioxide (CO2), as shown in cycle. The TCA cycle is an aerobic pathway, because oxygen (O2) is required as the final electron acceptor. Reactions such as the catabolism of some amino acids generate intermediates of the cycle and are called anaplerotic (from the Greek for \u201cfilling up\u201d) reactions. The TCA cycle also provides intermediates for a number of important anabolic reactions, such as", "Ketone bodies are an alternate to the use of glucose, and, thus, dependence on glucose increases. Because FA \u03b2-oxidation supplies the NADH and the nucleoside triphosphates needed for gluconeogenesis, glucose production decreases. The result is a hypoketotic hypoglycemia. Recall that this was seen with medium-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency. Case 4: Answers to Review Questions RQ1.Answer = D. The rise in reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) in the mitochondria decreases the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, fatty acid (FA) oxidation, and gluconeogenesis. NADH inhibits the isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction, the key regulated step of the TCA cycle, and the \u03b1ketoglutarate dehydrogenase reaction (see figure at bottom right). It also favors the reduction of oxaloacetate (OAA) to malate (not malate to OAA), decreasing the availability of OAA for condensation with", "energy (as ATP) and intermediates for other metabolic pathways. Glycolysis is at the hub of carbohydrate metabolism because virtually all sugars, whether arising from the diet or from catabolic reactions in the body, can ultimately be converted to glucose (Fig. 8.9A). Pyruvate is the end product of glycolysis in cells with mitochondria and an adequate supply of O2. This series of ten reactions is called aerobic glycolysis because O2 is required to reoxidize the NADH formed during the oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (Fig. 8.9B). Aerobic glycolysis sets the stage for the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, a major fuel of the TCA cycle. Alternatively, pyruvate is reduced to lactate as NADH is oxidized to NAD+ (Fig. 8.9C). This conversion of glucose to lactate is called anaerobic", "processes required in different tissues are not the same. For example, nerve cells, which are probably the most fastidious cells in the body, maintain almost no reserves of glycogen or fatty acids and rely almost entirely on a constant Figure 2\u201362 The nine essential amino acids.

Anaerobic glycolysis allows the production of ATP in tissues that lack mitochondria (for example, red blood cells [RBC] and parts of the eye) or in cells deprived of sufficient O2 (hypoxia). IV.

The resulting elevated hepatic acetyl CoA produced by fatty acid oxidation inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase (see p. 111) and activates pyruvate carboxylase ([PC] see p. 119). The OAA produced by PC is used by the liver for gluconeogenesis rather than for the TCA cycle. Additionally, fatty acid oxidation decreases the NAD+/NADH ratio, and the rise in NADH shifts OAA to malate (see p. 113).

Epidemiology Reveals That Many Cases of Cancer Are Preventable A certain irreducible background incidence of cancer is to be expected regardless of circumstances. As discussed in Chapter 5, mutations can never be absolutely avoided because they are an inescapable consequence of fundamental limitations on the accuracy of DNA replication and repair. If a person could live long enough, it is inevitable that at least one of his or her cells would eventually accumulate a set of mutations sufficient for cancer to develop.

A large and increasing number of genetic mutations and nucleotide polymorphisms have been associated with an increased risk of cancer. Testing for these genetic mutations could in theory define a high-risk population.

Maintaining the genetic stability that an organism needs for its survival requires not only an extremely accurate mechanism for replicating DNA, but also mechanisms for repairing the many accidental lesions that DNA continually suffers. Most such spontaneous changes in DNA are temporary because they are immediately corrected by a set of processes that are collectively called DNA repair. Of the tens of thousands of random changes created every day in the DNA of a human cell by heat, metabolic accidents, radiation of various sorts, and exposure to substances in the environment, only a few (less than 0.02%) accumulate as permanent mutations in the DNA sequence. The rest are eliminated with remarkable efficiency by DNA repair. The importance of DNA repair is evident from the", "billions of cells experience mutations every day, potentially disrupting the social controls.

Mitochondria are very complex organelles located in virtually all cells of the body. They perform a variety of functions such as intracellular signaling of oxygen tension and key roles in programmed cell death. From a biochemical perspective, mitochondria are the key site of energy production in the cell.

MECHANISM OF ENZYME ACTION The mechanism of enzyme action can be viewed from two different perspectives. The first treats catalysis in terms of energy changes that occur during the reaction. That is, enzymes provide an alternate, energetically favorable reaction pathway different from the uncatalyzed reaction. The second perspective describes how the active site chemically facilitates catalysis. A.

Two general processes contribute to maintenance of blood glucose during the fasting phase: hepatic glucose production and glucose sparing.

The kidneys eliminate these substances from the body at a rate that matches their production. Thus the kidneys regulate hormone concentrations within body fluids. The kidneys also represent an important route for elimination of foreign substances such as drugs, toxins (e.g., pesticides), and other chemicals from the body. Finally, the kidneys are important endocrine organs that produce and secrete renin, calcitriol, and erythropoietin.

Azotemia may result from reduced renal perfusion, intrinsic renal disease, or postrenal processes (ureteral obstruction; see below and Fig. 61-1). Precise determination of GFR is problematic, as both commonly measured indices (urea and creatinine) have characteristics that affect their accuracy as markers of clearance. Urea clearance may underestimate GFR significantly because of urea reabsorption by the tubule. In contrast, creatinine is derived from muscle metabolism of creatine, and its generation varies little from day to day. Creatinine clearance (CrCl), an approximation of GFR, is measured from plasma and urinary creatinine excretion rates for a defined period (usually 24 h) and is expressed in milliliters per minute: CrCl = (Uvol \u00d7 UCr)/(PCr \u00d7 Tmin).

Glycolysis illustrates how enzymes Couple oxidation to energy storage The formation of ATP during glycolysis provides a particularly clear demonstration of how enzymes couple energetically unfavorable reactions with favorable ones, thereby driving the many chemical reactions that make life possible.

The Nature of Primary Metabolic Myopathies The chemical energy for muscle contraction is provided by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP); ATP is restored by phosphocreatine and ADP acting in combination. These reactions are particularly important during brief, high-intensity exercise. During periods of prolonged muscle activity, rephosphorylation requires the availability of carbohydrates, fatty acids, and ketones, which are catabolized in mitochondria. Glycogen is the main sarcoplasmic source of carbohydrate, but blood glucose also moves freely in and out of muscle cells as needed during sustained exercise. The fatty acids in the blood, derived mainly from adipose tissue and intracellular lipid stores, constitute the other major source of energy. Carbohydrate is metabolized during aerobic and", "is present in the myoplasm, a small amount is located in the thick filament (near the M line). The creatine phosphokinase in the thick filament may participate in the rapid resynthesis of ATP near the myosin heads during muscle contraction.

Skeletal muscle fatigue during intense exercise is associated with depletion of the creatine phosphate store, although as described subsequently, this does not necessarily imply that the fatigue is caused by depletion of the creatine phosphate store.

Part of the enhanced performance observed after training involves motivational factors. Skeletal muscle fibers differentiate before they are innervated, and some neuromuscular junctions are formed well after birth.

Additional differences between fast and slow muscles include the following: 1. The motor neuron in slow muscle is more easily excited than that in fast muscle, and so slow muscles are typically recruited first. As stated previously, the high oxidative capacity of slow muscle, coupled with the low myosin ATPase activity, helps reduce the susceptibility to fatigue in slow muscle. 2.

Much of this lactate eventually diffuses into the bloodstream and can be used by the liver to make glucose (see p. 118). 2. Lactate utilization: The direction of the LDH reaction depends on the relative intracellular concentrations of pyruvate and lactate and on the ratio of NADH/NAD+. For example, in the liver and heart, this ratio is lower than in exercising muscle. Consequently, the liver and heart oxidize lactate (obtained from the blood) to pyruvate. In the liver, pyruvate is", "example, the addition of lactate to the blood that perfuses a heart metabolizing glucose leads to a reduction in glucose uptake and vice versa. At normal blood concentrations, glucose and lactate are consumed at approximately equal rates. In contrast, uptake of pyruvate is very low, as is its arterial concentration. For glucose, the threshold concentration is approximately 4 mmol/L. Below this blood level, no glucose is taken up by the myocardium. Insulin reduces the glucose threshold and increases the rate of glucose uptake by the heart. Cardiac utilization of lactate occurs in most circumstances; insulin does not affect its uptake by the myocardium. Under hypoxic conditions, glucose utilization is facilitated by an increase in the rate of transport across the myocardial cell wall.

More importantly, they are the principal fibers of the long muscles of the back in humans, where they are particularly adapted to the long, slow contraction needed to maintain erect posture. A high percentage of these fibers make up the muscles of high-endurance athletes such as marathon runners. \u0081 Type IIa fibers or fast oxidative glycolytic fibers are the intermediate fibers seen in fresh tissue.

Of importance in this chapter is that a number of physiological properties are correlated with this histochemical classification scheme. In particular, slow-twitch fibers, which contract and relax slowly as implied by their name, also generate low-force levels but essentially never fatigue. In contrast, the fast-twitch fiber contract and relax rapidly, generate higher levels of force, and fatigue at varying rates. The first motor units to be activated in many cases, either by voluntary effort or during reflex action or just CHAPTER 9 Organization of Motor Function to maintain posture, are those with the smallest motor axons. These motor units contain slow-twitch fibers and thus generate the smallest contractile force, allowing the initial contraction to be finely", "expressed in the muscle fiber. Further study showed that the intracellular Ca concentration in the muscle (secondary to differences in the activity pattern of the motor neuron) was an important determinant of whether the muscle fiber expressed the slow myosin isoform or the fast myosin isoform (see the section The myosin isoforms expressed in skeletal muscle can be distinguished on the basis of myosin heavy chain composition (see Fig. 12.15 Table 12.1 ). Slow-twitch muscle fibers express type I myosin heavy chain, whereas fast-twitch skeletal muscle fibers could contain type IIa, type IIx, or type IIb myosin heavy chains. Some fast-twitch muscle fibers may contain a mixture of type II myosin isoforms. Slow-twitch skeletal muscles are also characterized by a high oxidative capacity (see Table 12.1 ), which", "as marathon runners. \u0081 Type IIa fibers or fast oxidative glycolytic fibers are the intermediate fibers seen in fresh tissue. They are of medium size with many mitochondria and a high myoglobin content. In contrast to type I fibers, type IIa fibers contain large amounts of glycogen and are capable of anaerobic glycolysis. They make up fast-twitch, fatigue-resistant motor units that generate high peak muscle tension. Athletes who have a high percentage of these fast oxidative glycolytic fibers include 400and 800-m sprinters, middledistance swimmers, and hockey players. \u0081 Type IIb fibers or fast glycolytic fibers are large fibers that appear light pink in fresh specimens and contain less myoglobin and fewer mitochondria than type I and type IIa fibers. They have a low level of oxidative enzymes but", "myosin heavy chains. Some fast-twitch muscle fibers may contain a mixture of type II myosin isoforms. Slow-twitch skeletal muscles are also characterized by a high oxidative capacity (see Table 12.1 ), which in combination with the low myosin ATPase activity contribute to the fatigue resistance of slow-twitch muscle fibers. The oxidative capacity of the fast-twitch muscle fiber ranges from relatively high (in muscle fibers expressing type IIa myosin heavy chain) to low (in muscle fibers expressing type IIb myosin heavy chains). The low oxidative capacity of fast type IIb muscle fibers, coupled with the high myosin ATPase activity, increases the susceptibility of these muscle fibers to fatigue. Humans, however, rarely express the type IIb myosin heavy chain. Type IIb myosins are expressed in small animals such as rabbit", "fiber, which produces tetany. The increase in force during tetanic contractions is due to prolonged elevation of intracellular [Ca++]. 5. The two basic types of skeletal muscle fibers are distinguished on the basis of their speed of contraction (i.e., fast-twitch versus slow-twitch). The difference in speed of contraction is attributed to the expression of different myosin isoforms that differ in myosin ATPase activity. In addition to the difference in myosin ATPase activity, fast-and slow-twitch muscles also differ in metabolic activity, fiber diameter, motor unit size, sensitivity to tetany, and recruitment pattern. 6. Typically, slow-twitch muscles are recruited before fast-twitch muscle fibers because of the greater excitability of motor neurons innervating slow-twitch muscles. The high oxidative capacity of slow-twitch muscle fibers supports sustained contractile activity. Fast-twitch muscle fibers, in", "large fibers that appear light pink in fresh specimens and contain less myoglobin and fewer mitochondria than type I and type IIa fibers.

They also fatigue rapidly as a result of production of lactic acid. Thus, type IIb fibers are adapted for rapid contraction and precise, fine movements. They constitute most fibers of the extraocular muscles and the muscles that control the movements of the digits. These muscles have a greater number of neuromuscular junctions than do type I fibers, thus allowing"]}, {"id": "seed_task_9999", "name": "MMLU_test_collegemedicine", "is_classification": true, "instruction": "In this task, you are given a question and four different answer options.

As discussed previously, when a person stands, hydrostatic pressure increases in the legs and decreases in the head. Tissue pressure, or, more specifically, interstitial fluid pressure (Pi) outside the capillaries, opposes capillary filtration. The difference between Pc and Pi constitutes the driving force for filtration. Normally, Pi is close to zero, and so Pc essentially represents the hydrostatic driving force. Osmotic Forces. The key factor that restrains fluid loss from capillaries is the osmotic pressure of plasma proteins (such as albumin). This", "to the pressure in the lumbar subarachnoid space, and the intracranial CSF pressure drops correspondingly, so that it is close to zero in the standing position. As described above, the CSF pressure is in equilibrium with the capillary and prevenous vascular pressures, which are influenced mainly by circulatory changes that alter arteriolar tone. Elevations in systemic arterial pressure cause little or no increase of pressure at the capillary level because of cerebrovascular autoregulation, and hence, little increase in CSF pressure. Extremely low blood pressure (BP), in the range of a mean of 40 mm Hg, however, cannot be compensated for and correspondingly, lowers the CSF pressure (it follows that CSF pressure is zero, when the heart stops). In contrast to the limited effect caused by changes in arterial", "alone, as occurs in the feet when a person stands up, would elevate capillary pressure and enhance filtration. However, the increase in transmural pressure closes precapillary vessels (myogenic mechanism; see ), and hence the capillary filtration coefficient actually decreases. This reduction in capillary surface available for filtration prevents large amounts of fluid from leaving the capillaries and entering the interstitial space. In a healthy individual, the filtration coefficient (kt) for the whole body is approximately 0.006 mL/minute/100 g of tissue/mm Hg. For a 70-kg man, an elevation in Pv of 10 mm Hg for 10 minutes would increase filtration from capillaries by 420 mL.

This equilibrium value of Pv (6 mm Hg) for a cardiac output of 1 L/minute also appears on the vascular function curve of Fig. 19.3 (point B). The 1\u2013mm Hg reduction in Pv reflects a net transfer of blood from the veins to the arteries of the circuit.

Moreover, it does not account for the effect of gravity in causing venous pooling. When a person is standing upright, gravity causes blood to accumulate in the lower extremities and distend both the arteries and veins. Because venous compliance is so much greater than arterial compliance, this distention occurs more on the venous side than on the arterial side of the circuit.

No amount of effort will increase the flow further because the higher pleural pressure tends to collapse the airway at the equal pressure point, just as it also tends to increase the gradient for expiratory gas flow. Under these conditions, airflow is independent of the total driving pressure. Hence the expiratory flow is effort independent and flow limited. It is also why airway resistance is greater during exhalation than during inspiration. In the absence of lung disease, the equal pressure point occurs in airways that contain cartilage, and thus they resist collapse. The equal pressure point, however, is not static. As lung volume decreases and as elastic recoil pressure decreases, the equal pressure point moves closer to the alveoli.

Upon recovery of the BP, the response in cerebrovascular tone is delayed, thereby allowing intracranial blood volume to accumulate in the dilated vascular bed, and raising ICP in the form of a plateau wave. In support of this explanation is the observation that a brief period of induced elevation of BP paradoxically restores the normal cerebrovascular tone and leads to an abrupt cessation of a plateau wave. The configuration of the Lundberg B-waves, which are ballistic ICP waveforms corresponding to the inflow of blood into the cerebral vessels during systole, give some sense of cerebral dynamics.

Thus the endothelium plays an important role in regulating blood flow to specific vascular beds. The metabolic activity of a tissue governs blood flow in that tissue. Any intervention that results in inadequate O2 supply prompts the formation of vasodilator metabolites that are released from the tissue and act locally to dilate the resistance vessels. When the metabolic rate of the tissue increases, or when O2 delivery to the tissue decreases, more vasodilator substances are released (see Chapter 17).

However, significant increases in the phosphate concentration and in osmolarity are not always observed during muscle contraction, and they may increase blood flow only transiently. Therefore, they probably do not mediate the vasodilation observed during muscular activity. Potassium is released at the onset of skeletal muscle contraction or with an increase in cardiac muscle activity.

It is unlikely that oxygenation of venous blood alters its K+ or phosphate content or its osmolarity and thereby neutralizes its vasodilator effect.

It is unclear whether with these individuals the diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria would be met.

CHAPTER SUMMARY The flow of intermediates through metabolic pathways is controlled by four regulatory mechanisms: 1) the availability of substrates, 2) allosteric activation and inhibition of enzymes, 3) covalent modification of enzymes, and 4) induction-repression of enzyme synthesis. In the absorptive state, the 2-to 4-hour period after ingestion of a meal, these mechanisms insure that available nutrients are captured as glycogen, triacylglycerol (TAG), and protein (Fig. 24.20). During this interval, transient increases in plasma glucose, amino acids, and TAG occur, the last primarily as components of chylomicrons synthesized by the intestinal mucosal cells. The pancreas responds to the elevated levels", "This important reaction takes place in the mammalian mitochondrion, as part of the pathway that oxidizes sugars to CO2 and H2O (see page 82). (A\u2013C, adapted from T. Maier et al., Quart. Rev. Biophys. 43:373\u2013422, 2010; D, from J.L.S. Milne et al., J. Biol.

Reactions limited by the speed of diffusion can thereby be speeded up by a factor of 10.

Although the liver contributes in a pivotal way to the maintenance of whole-body biochemical status, a complete discussion of all the underpinning reactions is beyond the scope of this chapter. We will confine our discussion primarily to hepatic functions that relate to gastrointestinal physiology. Metabolic Functions of the Liver Hepatocytes contribute to metabolism of the major nutrients: carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. Thus the liver plays an important role in glucose metabolism by engaging in gluconeogenesis, conversion of other sugars to glucose. The liver also stores glucose as glycogen at times of glucose excess (e.g., postprandial period) and then releases stored glucose into the bloodstream as it is needed. This process is referred to as the glucose buffer function of the liver. When hepatic", "processes required in different tissues are not the same. For example, nerve cells, which are probably the most fastidious cells in the body, maintain almost no reserves of glycogen or fatty acids and rely almost entirely on a constant Figure 2\u201362 The nine essential amino acids. These cannot be synthesized by human cells and so must be supplied in the diet. Figure 2\u201363 Glycolysis and the citric acid cycle are at the center of an elaborate set of metabolic pathways in human cells. some 2000 metabolic reactions are shown schematically with the reactions of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle in red. many other reactions either lead into these two central pathways\u2014delivering small molecules to be catabolized with production of energy\u2014or they lead outward and thereby supply carbon", "Glucokinase differs from hexokinases I\u2013III in several important properties. For example, it has a much higher Km, requiring a higher glucose concentration for half-saturation (see Fig. 8.13). Thus, glucokinase functions only when the intracellular concentration of glucose in the hepatocyte is elevated such as during the brief period following consumption of a carbohydrate-rich meal, when high levels of glucose are delivered to the liver via the portal vein. Glucokinase has a high Vmax, allowing the liver to effectively remove the flood of glucose delivered by the portal blood. This prevents large amounts of glucose from entering the systemic circulation following such a meal, thereby minimizing hyperglycemia during the absorptive period. [Note: GLUT-2 insures that blood glucose equilibrates rapidly across the hepatocyte membrane.] b. Regulation: Glucokinase activity is not", "but ignores its mirror image, L-glucose. Suppose that you were able to synthesize hexokinase entirely from D-amino acids, which are the mirror image of the normal L-amino acids. a. Assuming that the \u201cD\u201d enzyme would fold to a stable conformation, what relationship would you expect it to bear to the normal \u201cL\u201d enzyme? b.

In animal cells, by contrast, most inward transport across the plasma membrane is driven by the Na+ gradient (high Na+ outside, low Na+ inside) that is established by the Na+-K+ pump (see Figure 11\u201315). Some unusual bacteria have adapted to live in a very alkaline environment and yet must maintain their cytoplasm at a physiological pH. For these cells, any attempt to generate an electrochemical H+ gradient would be opposed by a large H+ concentration gradient in the wrong direction (H+ higher inside than outside)."]}, {"id": "seed_task_9999", "name": "MMLU_test_collegemedicine", "is_classification": true, "instruction": "In this task, you are given a question and four different answer options.

Finally, and perhaps most significantly, even the fastest-growing organisms require 1\u20132 days of processing for identification and 2\u20133 days for determination of susceptibilities. Slower-growing organisms take even longer: for instance, weeks must pass before drug-resistant M. tuberculosis can be identified by growth phenotype.

Bioenergetics makes use of a few basic ideas from the field of thermodynamics, particularly the concept of free energy. Because changes in free", "VIII. ENZYME REGULATION The regulation of the reaction velocity of enzymes is essential if an organism is to coordinate its numerous metabolic processes. The rates of most enzymes are responsive to changes in substrate concentration, because the intracellular level of many substrates is in the range of the Km. Thus, an increase in substrate concentration prompts an increase in reaction rate, which tends to return the concentration of substrate toward normal. In addition, some enzymes with specialized regulatory functions respond to allosteric effectors and/or covalent modification or they show altered rates of enzyme synthesis (or degradation) when physiologic conditions are changed. A. Allosteric enzymes Allosteric enzymes are regulated by molecules called effectors that bind noncovalently at a site other than the active site.

In this view, ligand binding perturbs an all-or-none equilibrium between these two states, thereby changing the proportion of active molecules. Both models represent true and useful concepts.

CHAPTER SUMMARY Enzymes are protein catalysts that increase the velocity of a chemical reaction by lowering the energy of the transition state (Fig. 5.23). They are not consumed during the reaction. Enzyme molecules contain a special cleft called the active site, which contains amino acid side chains that participate in substrate binding and catalysis. The active site binds the substrate, forming an enzyme\u2013substrate (ES) complex. Binding is thought to cause a conformational change in the enzyme (induced fit) that allows catalysis. ES is converted to enzyme and product. An enzyme allows a reaction to proceed rapidly under conditions prevailing in the cell by providing an alternate reaction pathway with a lower activation energy (Ea). Because the", "a standard way to any other amino acid in the set; attached to this core is a side group that gives each amino acid a distinctive chemical character. Each of the protein molecules is a polypeptide, created by joining its amino acids in a particular sequence. Through billions of years of evolution, this sequence has been selected to give the protein a useful function. Thus, by folding into a precise three-dimensional form with reactive sites on its surface (Figure 1\u20137A), these amino-acid polymers can bind with high specificity to other molecules and can act as enzymes to catalyze reactions that make or break covalent bonds. In this way they direct the vast majority of chemical processes in the cell (Figure 1\u20137B).

In the example shown in Figure 3\u201360, the first molecule of an inhibitory ligand binds with great difficulty since its binding disrupts an energetically favorable interaction between the two identical monomers in the dimer.

The presence of four different bases provides surprising genetic diversity. In the protein-coding regions of genes, the DNA bases are arranged into codons, a triplet of bases that specifies a particular amino acid. It is possible to arrange the four bases into 64 different triplet codons (43).

How to translate a codon: This table can be used to translate any codon and, thus, to determine which amino acids are coded for by an mRNA sequence.

RNA is a linear polymer of four different nucleotides, so there are 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 = 64 possible combinations of three nucleotides: the triplets AAA, AUA, AUG, and so on. However, only 20 different amino acids are commonly found in proteins.

The precise transfer of information from mRNA to protein is governed by genetic code, the set of rules by which codons are translated into an amino acid (Table 15-2). A codon, a triplet of three bases, codes for one amino acid. In this case, random combinations of the four bases form 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4, or 64 codes. Because 64 codes are more than enough for 20 amino acids, most amino acids are coded by more than one codon. The start codon is AUG, which also corresponds to methionine; therefore, almost all proteins begin with this amino acid.

A large ribosomal subunit then binds to complete the ribosome and begin protein synthesis.

Therefore, it is important to understand how current injected at one point along the axon affects the membrane potential at other points because this both helps explain why action potentials are needed and helps explain some of their characteristics.

(2) The action potential is generally propagated down the entire length of the axon without decrement (i.e., it maintains its size and shape because it is regenerated as it travels along the axon). (3) It is an all-or-none response, which means that a stimulus normally either produces a full-sized action potential or fails to produce one.

The overall effect of a particular synapse is dependent on its location. To understand this concept fully, we must first recall that action potentials are typically generated at the initial segment of the cell because it has the highest density of voltage-gated Na+ channels and therefore the lowest threshold for initiation of a spike. Thus, it is the summed amplitudes of the synaptic potentials at this point, the initial segment, that is critical for the decision to spike.

This pool, however, is continually replenished during contraction, as described later, so that even when the muscle fatigues, ATP stores are only modestly decreased. Muscle cells contain creatine phosphate, which is used to convert ADP to ATP and thus replenish the ATP store during muscle contraction. The creatine phosphate store represents the immediate high-energy source for replenishing the ATP supply in skeletal muscle, especially during intense exercise.

The creatine phosphokinase in the thick filament may participate in the rapid resynthesis of", "of high-intensity exercise or prolonged exercise, the myoplasmic ATP level does not decrease substantially. In view of the reliance of all cells on the availability of ATP to maintain viability, fatigue has been described as a protective mechanism to minimize the risk of muscle cell injury or death. Consequently, it is likely that skeletal muscle cells have developed redundant systems to ensure that ATP levels do not drop to dangerously low levels and hence risk the viability of the cell. Most persons tire and cease exercise long before the motor unit fatigues. General physical fatigue may be defined as a homeostatic disturbance produced by work. The basis for the perceived discomfort (or even pain) probably involves many factors. These factors may include a decrease in plasma glucose levels", "is present in the myoplasm, a small amount is located in the thick filament (near the M line). The creatine phosphokinase in the thick filament may participate in the rapid resynthesis of ATP near the myosin heads during muscle contraction. The phosphate store created, however, is only about five times the size of the ATP store and thus cannot support prolonged periods of contraction (less than a minute of maximal muscle activity). Skeletal muscle fatigue during intense exercise is associated with depletion of the creatine phosphate store, although as described subsequently, this does not necessarily imply that the fatigue is caused by depletion of the creatine phosphate store.

Glucose is the greatly preferred energy source for the brain and the required energy source for cells with few or no mitochondria such as mature red blood cells. Glucose is also essential as an energy source for exercising muscle, where it is the substrate for anaerobic glycolysis. Blood glucose can be obtained from three primary sources: the diet, glycogen degradation, and gluconeogenesis. Dietary intake of glucose and glucose precursors, such as starch (a polysaccharide), disaccharides, and monosaccharides, is sporadic and, depending on the diet, is not always a reliable source", "glycogen, which are then metabolized by a combination of glycolysis (in the cytosol) and oxidative phosphorylation (in the mitochondria) to yield the equivalent of 37 mol of ATP per mole of glucose 1-phosphate. Blood glucose yields 36 mol of ATP per mole of glucose because 1 ATP is used to phosphorylate glucose at the start of glycolysis. These ATP yields, however, are dependent on an adequate oxygen supply. Under anaerobic conditions, in contrast, metabolism of glycogen and glucose yields only 3 and 2 mol of ATP per mole of glucose 1-phosphate and glucose, respectively (along with 2 mol of lactate). As discussed later, muscle fatigue during prolonged exercise is associated with depletion of glycogen stores in the muscle.

We start with some of the basic principles on which all of these processes depend. the redox potential Is a Measure of Electron affinities In chemical reactions, any electrons removed from one molecule are always passed to another, so that whenever one molecule is oxidized, another is reduced. As with any other chemical reaction, the tendency of such redox reactions to proceed spontaneously depends on the free-energy change (\u2206G)", "make up 15\u201330% of the membrane proteins in all cells.

Cells can also transfer macromolecules and even large particles across their membranes, but the mechanisms involved in most of these cases differ from those used for transferring small molecules, and they are discussed in Chapters 12 and 13. We begin this chapter by describing some general principles of how small water-soluble molecules traverse cell membranes. We then consider, in turn, the two main classes of membrane proteins that mediate this transmembrane traffic: transporters, which undergo sequential conformational changes to transport specific small molecules across membranes, and channels, which form narrow pores, allowing passive transmembrane movement,", "the cytosol to the cell exterior necessarily have narrow, highly selective pores that can open and close rapidly.

As discussed earlier, however, channels cannot be coupled to an energy source to perform active transport, so the transport they mediate is always passive (downhill).

In principle, ATP synthase can also run in reverse as an ATP-powered proton pump that converts the energy of ATP back into a proton gradient across the membrane. In many bacteria, the rotor of the ATP synthase in the plasma membrane changes direction routinely, from ATP synthesis mode in aerobic respiration, to ATP hydrolysis mode in anaerobic metabolism. In this latter case, ATP hydrolysis serves to maintain the proton gradient across the plasma membrane, which is used to power many other essential cell functions including nutrient transport and the rotation of bacterial flagella. The V-type ATPases that acidify certain cellular organelles are architecturally similar to the F-type ATP synthases, but they normally function", "added to ADP (adenosine diphosphate). When required, ATP gives up its energy packet through its energetically favorable hydrolysis to ADP and inorganic phosphate (Figure 2\u201333). The regenerated ADP is then available to be used for another round of the phosphorylation reaction that forms ATP. The energetically favorable reaction of ATP hydrolysis is coupled to many otherwise unfavorable reactions through which other molecules are synthesized. Many of these coupled reactions involve the transfer of the terminal phosphate in ATP to another molecule, as illustrated by the phosphorylation reaction in Figure 2\u201334. As the most abundant activated carrier in cells, ATP is the principle energy currency. To give just two examples, it supplies energy for many of the pumps that transport substances into and out of the cell (discussed in", "membrane that help to maintain the cytosolic pH at about 7.2.

One of the antiporters that uses the first mechanism is a Na+\u2013H+ exchanger, which couples an influx of Na+ to an efflux of H+.

ATP is synthesized in an energetically unfavorable phosphorylation reaction in which a phosphate group is added to ADP (adenosine diphosphate).

A growing tumor needs nutrients in abundance to provide the building blocks to make new macromolecules. Correspondingly, most tumors have a metabolism more similar to that of a growing embryo than to that of normal adult tissue. Tumor cells consume glucose avidly, importing it from the blood at a rate that can be as much as 100 times higher than neighboring normal cells. Moreover, only a small fraction of this imported glucose is used for production of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation.

Additional branch synthesis: After elongation of these two ends has been accomplished, their terminal six to eight glucosyl residues can be removed and used to make additional branches. IV. DEGRADATION (GLYCOGENOLYSIS) The degradative pathway that mobilizes stored glycogen in liver and skeletal muscle is not a reversal of the synthetic reactions. Instead, a separate set of cytosolic enzymes is required. When glycogen is degraded, the primary product is glucose 1-phosphate, obtained by breaking \u03b1(1\u21924) glycosidic bonds. In addition, free glucose is released from each \u03b1(1\u21926)\u2013linked glucosyl residue (branch point). A.

The synthesis and degradation of glycogen are rapidly regulated according to need. When cells need more ATP than they can generate from the food molecules taken in from the bloodstream, they break down glycogen in a reaction that produces glucose 1-phosphate, which is rapidly converted to glucose 6-phosphate for glycolysis (Figure 2\u201352).

CHAPTER SUMMARY The main stores of glycogen in the body are found in skeletal muscle, where they serve as a fuel reserve for the synthesis of ATP during muscle contraction, and in the liver, where they are used to maintain the blood glucose concentration, particularly during the early stages of a fast. Glycogen is a highly branched polymer of \u03b1-D-glucose. The primary glycosidic bond is an \u03b1(1\u21924) linkage. After about 8\u201314 glucosyl residues, there is a branch containing an \u03b1(1\u21926) linkage. Uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose, the building block of glycogen, is synthesized from glucose 1-phosphate and UTP by UDP\u2013glucose pyrophosphorylase (Fig. 11.14). Glucose from UDP-glucose is transferred to the nonreducing ends of glycogen chains by primer-requiring glycogen synthase, which makes the \u03b1(1\u21924) linkages. The", "for gluconeogenesis. Thus gluconeogenesis requires an integration of catabolic pathways in adipocytes and skeletal myocytes with anabolic gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes. Gluconeogenesis eventually supplants glycogenolysis and can continue as long as precursors flow into the liver. Glucose sparing represents the other general process that contributes to maintenance of adequate circulating glucose levels during the fasting phase. Glucose sparing means the switching of fuel utilization from glucose to a nongluconeogenic fuel in most cell types, but especially in skeletal muscle, which represents the potentially largest single consumer of glucose.

The proteins are dissolved in a solution that includes a powerful negatively charged detergent, sodium dodecyl sulfate, or SDS (Figure 8\u201312). Because this detergent binds to hydrophobic regions of the protein molecules, causing them to unfold into extended polypeptide chains, the individual protein molecules are released from their associations with other proteins or lipid molecules and rendered freely soluble in the detergent solution.

The sample is dissolved in a small volume of a solution containing a nonionic (uncharged) detergent, together with \u03b2-mercaptoethanol and the denaturing reagent urea.

Over several hours, the DNA fragments become spread out across the gel according to size, forming a ladder of discrete bands, each composed of a collection of DNA molecules of identical length (Figure 8\u201325A and B).

The Nature of Primary Metabolic Myopathies The chemical energy for muscle contraction is provided by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP); ATP is restored by phosphocreatine and ADP acting in combination. These reactions are particularly important during brief, high-intensity exercise. During periods of prolonged muscle activity, rephosphorylation requires the availability of carbohydrates, fatty acids, and ketones, which are catabolized in mitochondria. Glycogen is the main sarcoplasmic source of carbohydrate, but blood glucose also moves freely in and out of muscle cells as needed during sustained exercise. The fatty acids in the blood, derived mainly from adipose tissue and intracellular lipid stores, constitute the other major source of energy. Carbohydrate is metabolized during aerobic and", "that the fatigue is caused by depletion of the creatine phosphate store. Because the creatine phosphokinase\u2013catalyzed reaction is reversible, the muscle cell replenishes the creatine phosphate pool during recovery from fatigue by using ATP synthesized through oxidative phosphorylation. Muscle cells contain glycogen, which can be metabolized during muscle contraction to provide glucose for oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, both of which generate ATP to replenish the ATP store. Muscle cells can also take up glucose from blood, a process that is stimulated by insulin (see Chapter 39). The cytosolic enzyme phosphory lase releases glucose 1-phosphate residues from glycogen, which are then metabolized by a combination of glycolysis (in the cytosol) and oxidative phosphorylation (in the mitochondria) to yield the equivalent of 37 mol of ATP per mole of glucose", "Energy Production by Oxidative Metabolism.

This decay represents the rapid and almost total failure of the fast motor units. The decline in force/stress is paralleled by depletion of glycogen and creatine phosphate stores and the accumulation of lactic acid. Of importance is that the decline in force/ stress occurs when the ATP pool is not greatly reduced, so that the muscle fibers do not go into rigor. In contrast, the slow motor units are able to meet the energy demands of fibers under this condition, and they do not exhibit significant fatigue, even after many hours. Evidently, some factor associated with energy metabolism can inhibit", "the lactate generated by glycolysis. The increased cardiac and respiratory work during recovery also contributes to the increased oxygen consumption seen at this time and explains why more oxygen has to be \u201crepaid\u201d than was \u201cborrowed.\u201d Some oxygen debt occurs even with low levels of exercise because slow oxidative motor units consume considerable ATP, derived from creatine phosphate or glycolysis, before oxidative metabolism can increase ATP production to meet steady-state requirements. The oxygen debt is much greater with strenuous exercise, when fast glycolytic motor units are used (Fig. 12.18 ). The oxygen debt is approximately equal to the energy consumed during exercise minus that supplied by oxidative metabolism (i.e., the darkand light-colored areas in Fig. 12.18 are approximately equal). As indicated earlier, the additional oxygen used during recovery", "is present in the myoplasm, a small amount is located in the thick filament (near the M line). The creatine phosphokinase in the thick filament may participate in the rapid resynthesis of ATP near the myosin heads during muscle contraction. The phosphate store created, however, is only about five times the size of the ATP store and thus cannot support prolonged periods of contraction (less than a minute of maximal muscle activity). Skeletal muscle fatigue during intense exercise is associated with depletion of the creatine phosphate store, although as described subsequently, this does not necessarily imply that the fatigue is caused by depletion of the creatine phosphate store. Because the creatine phosphokinase\u2013catalyzed reaction is reversible, the muscle cell replenishes the creatine phosphate pool during recovery from fatigue by", "although the accumulation of various metabolic products (lactate, Pi, ADP) has been implicated. In view of the importance of preventing depletion of myoplasmic ATP, which would affect the viability of the cell, it is likely that multiple mechanisms may have been developed to induce fatigue and hence lower the rate of ATP hydrolysis before the individual risks injury or death of the skeletal muscle cell. 11. When the energy demands of an exercising muscle cannot be met by oxidative metabolism, an oxygen debt is incurred. Increased breathing during the recovery period after exercise reflects this oxygen debt. The greater the reliance on anaerobic metabolism to meet the energy requirements of muscle contraction, the greater the oxygen debt. Gordon AM, Homsher E, Regnier M.

The mechanism(s) contributing to the stretch-induced increase in Ca++ sensitivity of cardiac contraction are not clear, but appears to involve the intracellular elastic protein titin, as well as regulatory proteins (e.g., troponinC). As in skeletal muscle, myosin uses the energy in ATP to generate force, so the ATP pool, which is small, must be continually replenished. Typically, this replenishment of ATP pools is accomplished by aerobic metabolism, including the oxidation of fats and carbohydrates. During times of ischemia, the creatine phosphate pool, which converts ADP to ATP,", "the heart preferentially uses the substrate that is available in the largest concentration. The oxidation of amino acids makes a small contribution to myocardial energy expenditure. Normally, the heart derives its energy by oxidative phosphorylation, in which each mole of glucose yields 36 mol of ATP. However, during hypoxia, glycolysis takes over, and 2 mol of ATP is provided by each mole of glucose; \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids is also curtailed. If hypoxia is prolonged, cellular creatine phosphate and eventually ATP are depleted. In ischemia, lactic acid accumulates and decreases intracellular pH.

The rugged stratified squamous epithelium may be able to survive the noxious chemicals in cigarette smoke that the more fragile specialized epithelium would not tolerate. Although the metaplastic squamous epithelium has survival advantages, important protective mechanisms are lost, such as mucus secretion and ciliary clearance of particulate matter. Epithelial metaplasia is therefore a double-edged sword. Because vitamin A is essential for normal epithelial differentiation, its deficiency also may induce squamous metaplasia in the respiratory epithelium. Metaplasia need not always occur in the direction of columnar to squamous epithelium; in chronic gastric reflux, the normal stratified squamous epithelium of the lower", "AFP levels and positive assay results for acetylcholinesterase.

With current imaging technology, most neural-tube defects are detected with sonography, and targeted sonography is the diagnostic test of choice (Dashe, 2006). Pregnant women now have the option of neural-tube defect screening with either MSAFP or sonography (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 20 16c).

If the nucleotide listed in the first column is present at the third, or wobble, position of the codon, it can base-pair with any of the nucleotides listed in the second column. Thus, for example, when inosine (I) is present in the wobble position of the tRNA anticodon, the tRNA can recognize any one of three different codons in bacteria and either of two codons in eukaryotes. The inosine in tRNAs is formed from the deamination of adenosine (see Figure 6\u201353),", "added prefix deoxy-(for example, deoxyadenosine).

Their high levels of mitochondrial oxidative enzymes are demonstrated by their strong succinic dehydrogenase and NADH-TR histochemical staining reactions as described previously (see Fig. 11.3).

Weightlifting, for example, can require a lot of power for short duration. In order to meet the demands for more force, additional motor units are recruited. In comparison with slow motor units, the fast motor units typically contain more muscle fibers (see Table 12.2 ). Fast muscle fibers also have a larger diameter than do slow muscle fibers. Thus recruitment of fast motor units can help meet the increased demands of burst activities such as weightlifting.

The increase in force during tetanic contractions is due to prolonged elevation of intracellular [Ca++]. 5. The two basic types of skeletal muscle fibers are distinguished on the basis of their speed of contraction (i.e., fast-twitch versus slow-twitch). The difference in speed of contraction is attributed to the expression of different myosin isoforms that differ in myosin ATPase activity. In addition to the difference in myosin ATPase activity, fast-and slow-twitch muscles also differ in metabolic activity, fiber diameter, motor unit size, sensitivity to tetany, and recruitment pattern. 6. Typically, slow-twitch muscles are recruited before fast-twitch muscle fibers because of the greater excitability of motor neurons innervating slow-twitch muscles.

They also fatigue rapidly as a result of production of lactic acid. Thus, type IIb fibers are adapted for rapid contraction and precise, fine movements.

The high myosin ATPase activity in fast muscle fibers and the increase in diffusion distance (resulting from the large diameter of the fast muscle fibers), however, increase the susceptibility of fast muscle fibers to fatigue. Additional differences between fast and slow muscles include the following: 1. The motor neuron in slow muscle is more easily excited than that in fast muscle, and so slow muscles are typically recruited first. As stated previously, the high oxidative capacity of slow muscle, coupled with the low myosin ATPase activity, helps reduce the susceptibility to fatigue in slow muscle. 2.

These fibers have great resistance to fatigue but generate less tension than other fibers. Their myosin ATPase reaction velocity is the slowest of all of the fiber types.

This decay represents the rapid and almost total failure of the fast motor units. The decline in force/stress is paralleled by depletion of glycogen and creatine phosphate stores and the accumulation of lactic acid. Of importance is that the decline in force/ stress occurs when the ATP pool is not greatly reduced, so that the muscle fibers do not go into rigor. In contrast, the slow motor units are able to meet the energy demands of fibers under this condition, and they do not exhibit significant fatigue, even after many hours.

A number of other factors, including glycogen depletion from a specialized compartment, a localized increase in [ADP], extracellular elevation of [K+], and generation of oxygen free radicals, have also been implicated in various forms of exercise-induced muscle fatigue. Finally, the central nervous system contributes to fatigue, especially in how fatigue is perceived by the individual.

Excitatory input can be reduced by sectioning the appropriate spinal or dorsal root or by severing the tendon, which functionally inactivates peripheral mechanoreceptors.

As we have just seen, ATP can be formed readily from ADP when a reaction intermediate is formed with a phosphate bond of higher energy than the terminal phosphate bond in ATP. Phosphate bonds can be ordered in energy by comparing the standard free-energy change (\u2206G\u00b0) for the breakage of each bond by hydrolysis. Figure 2\u201350 compares the high-energy phosphoanhydride bonds in ATP with the energy of some other phosphate bonds, several of which are generated during glycolysis.

Because two molecules of aTp are hydrolyzed in the early, energy-investment phase, glycolysis results in the net synthesis of 2 aTp and 2 naDh", "conveniently sized packets to carrier molecules\u2014most often aTp and naDh. at each step, an enzyme controls the reaction by reducing the activation-energy barrier that has to be surmounted before the specific reaction can occur.

In aerobic organisms, these NADH molecules donate their electrons to the electron-transport chain described in Chapter 14, and the NAD+ formed from the NADH is used again for glycolysis (see step 6 in Panel 2\u20138, pp. 104\u2013105). fermentations produce aTp in the absence of oxygen For", "and GDp are close relatives of aTp and aDp, respectively. At the end of this series of electron transfers, the electrons are passed to molecules of oxygen gas (O2) that have diffused into the mitochondrion, which simultaneously combine with protons (H+) from the surrounding solution to produce water. The electrons have now reached a low energy level, and all the available energy has been extracted from the oxidized food molecule. This process, termed oxidative phosphorylation (Figure 2\u201361), also occurs in the plasma membrane of bacteria. As one of the most remarkable achievements of cell evolution, it is a central topic of Chapter 14. In total, the complete oxidation of a molecule of glucose to H2O and CO2 is used by the cell to produce about 30 molecules of", "part of a molecule. examples of molecules containing such bonds are given on the right, with the standard free-energy change for hydrolysis in kilojoules. The transfer of a phosphate group from one molecule to another is energetically favorable if the free-energy change (\u0394G) for hydrolysis of the phosphate bond of the first molecule is more negative than that for hydrolysis of the phosphate bond in the second. Thus, under standard conditions, a phosphate group is readily transferred from 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate to aDp to form aTp. (standard conditions often do not pertain to living cells, where the relative concentrations of reactants and products will influence the actual change in free energy.) The hydrolysis reaction can be viewed as the transfer of the phosphate group to water. subunits in the large", "energy of a size sufficient to power a chemical reaction elsewhere in the cell. aTp is the most Widely Used activated Carrier molecule The most important and versatile of the activated carriers in cells is ATP (adenosine triphosphate). Just as the energy stored in the raised bucket of water in Figure 2\u201332B can drive a wide variety of hydraulic machines, ATP is a convenient and versatile store, or currency, of energy used to drive a variety of chemical reactions in cells. ATP is synthesized in an energetically unfavorable phosphorylation reaction in which a phosphate group is added to ADP (adenosine diphosphate). When required, ATP gives up its energy packet through its energetically favorable hydrolysis to ADP and inorganic phosphate (Figure 2\u201333).

When required, ATP gives up its energy packet through its energetically favorable hydrolysis to ADP and inorganic phosphate (Figure 2\u201333).

The energetically favorable reaction of ATP hydrolysis is coupled to many otherwise unfavorable reactions through which other molecules are synthesized. Many of these coupled reactions involve the transfer of the terminal phosphate in ATP to another molecule, as illustrated by the phosphorylation reaction in Figure 2\u201334.

Through billions of years of evolution, this sequence has been selected to give the protein a useful function. Thus, by folding into a precise three-dimensional form with reactive sites on its surface (Figure 1\u20137A), these amino-acid polymers can bind with high specificity to other molecules and can act as enzymes to catalyze reactions that make or break covalent bonds.

Conversely, the amino acid pool is depleted by three routes: 1) synthesis of body protein, 2) consumption of amino acids as precursors of essential nitrogen-containing small molecules, and 3) conversion of amino acids to glucose, glycogen, fatty acids, and ketone bodies or oxidation to CO2 + H2O (see Fig. 19.2).

Enzymes that hydrolyze peptide bonds are termed peptidases (proteases). [Note: Exopeptidases cut at the ends of proteins and are divided into aminopeptidases and carboxypeptidases.

The NH3 picks up protons from ketone body dissociation and is excreted in the urine as ammonium (NH4+), thereby decreasing the acid load in the body (Fig. 24.19). Therefore, in long-term fasting, there is a switch from nitrogen disposal in the form of urea to disposal in the form of NH4 .

Transfer RNA At least one specific type of tRNA is required for each amino acid. In humans, there are at least 50 species of tRNA, whereas bacteria contain at least 30 species. Because there are only 20 different amino acids commonly carried by tRNA, some amino acids have more than one", "end Sequencing is a stepwise process of identifying the specific amino acid at each position in the peptide chain, beginning at the N-terminal end. Phenylisothiocyanate, known as Edman reagent, is used to label the amino-terminal residue under mildly alkaline conditions (Fig. 2.4). The resulting phenylthiohydantoin (PTH) derivative introduces an instability in the N-terminal peptide bond such that it can be hydrolyzed without cleaving the other peptide bonds. The identity of the amino acid derivative can then be determined. Edman reagent can be applied repeatedly to the shortened peptide obtained in each previous cycle. Automated sequencers are now used. D. Cleaving the polypeptide into smaller fragments Many polypeptides have a primary structure composed of >100 amino acids. Such molecules cannot be sequenced directly from end to end. However, these", "In general, zymogens contain extra amino acids in their sequences that prevent them from being catalytically active.

B. Digestion by pancreatic enzymes On entering the small intestine, the polypeptides produced in the stomach by the action of pepsin are further cleaved to oligopeptides and amino acids by a group of pancreatic proteases that include both endopeptidases (that cleave within) and exopeptidases (that cut at an end).

Reduction to lactate is the major fate for pyruvate in tissues that are poorly vascularized (for example, the lens and cornea of the eye and the kidney medulla) or in RBC that lack mitochondria. 1. Lactate formation in muscle: In exercising skeletal muscle, NADH production (by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and by the three NAD+-linked dehydrogenases of the TCA cycle, see p. 113) exceeds the oxidative capacity of the ETC. This results in an elevated NADH/NAD+ ratio, favoring reduction of pyruvate to lactate by LDH. Therefore, during intense", "example, the addition of lactate to the blood that perfuses a heart metabolizing glucose leads to a reduction in glucose uptake and vice versa. At normal blood concentrations, glucose and lactate are consumed at approximately equal rates. In contrast, uptake of pyruvate is very low, as is its arterial concentration. For glucose, the threshold concentration is approximately 4 mmol/L. Below this blood level, no glucose is taken up by the myocardium. Insulin reduces the glucose threshold and increases the rate of glucose uptake by the heart. Cardiac utilization of lactate occurs in most circumstances; insulin does not affect its uptake by the myocardium. Under hypoxic conditions, glucose utilization is facilitated by an increase in the rate of transport across the myocardial cell wall. However, lactate cannot be metabolized", "not affect its uptake by the myocardium. Under hypoxic conditions, glucose utilization is facilitated by an increase in the rate of transport across the myocardial cell wall. However, lactate cannot be metabolized by the hypoxic heart and is produced by the heart under anaerobic conditions. Associated with lactate production by the hypoxic heart is the breakdown of cardiac glycogen. Of the total cardiac O2 consumption, only 35% to 40% can be accounted for by the oxidation of carbohydrate. Thus the heart derives the major part of its energy from the oxidation of noncarbohydrate sources: namely, esterified and nonesterified fatty acids, which account for approximately 60% of the myocardial O2 consumption in people in the postabsorptive state. Various fatty acids have different thresholds for myocardial uptake, but these CHAPTER", "the heart preferentially uses the substrate that is available in the largest concentration. The oxidation of amino acids makes a small contribution to myocardial energy expenditure. Normally, the heart derives its energy by oxidative phosphorylation, in which each mole of glucose yields 36 mol of ATP. However, during hypoxia, glycolysis takes over, and 2 mol of ATP is provided by each mole of glucose; \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids is also curtailed. If hypoxia is prolonged, cellular creatine phosphate and eventually ATP are depleted. In ischemia, lactic acid accumulates and decreases intracellular pH. This condition inhibits glycolysis, fatty acid use, and protein synthesis, and therefore it results in cellular damage and eventually necrosis of myocardial cells. 1.

Aerobic glycolysis, in which pyruvate is the end product, occurs in cells with mitochondria and an adequate supply of oxygen ([O2], Fig. 8.25). Anaerobic glycolysis, in which lactic acid is the end product, occurs in cells that lack mitochondria and in cells deprived of sufficient O2.

The consequent reduction in cardiac output further reduces arterial pressure, a classic example of a positive feedback mechanism. Furthermore, reduced blood flow to peripheral tissues leads to an accumulation of vasodilator metabolites that decrease peripheral resistance and therefore aggravate the fall in arterial pressure. The inadequate blood flow during hemorrhage affects the metabolism of all cells. The decreased O2 delivery to cells accelerates tissue production of lactic acid and other acid metabolites. Moreover, impaired kidney function prevents adequate excretion of the excess H+ , and generalized metabolic acidosis ensues. The resulting depressant effect of acidosis on the heart is a further reduction in tissue perfusion, which aggravates the metabolic acidosis.

The greater glycogen stores within the muscle are not read-ily available for systemic use due to a deficiency in glucose-6-phosphatase but are available for the energy needs of muscle cells.

CRH is also under strong diurnal rhythmic regulation emerging from the suprachiasmatic nucleus, such that cortisol levels surge during the early predawn and morning hours and then continually decline throughout the day and evening. CRH acutely stimulates release of ACTH and chronically increases proopiomelanocortin (POMC) gene expression and corticotrope hypertrophy and proliferation.

Severe chronic depression can reset the HPA axis as a result of hypersecretion of CRH and is a factor in the development of tertiary hypercortisolism.

During periods of prolonged muscle activity, rephosphorylation requires the availability of carbohydrates, fatty acids, and ketones, which are catabolized in mitochondria. Glycogen is the main sarcoplasmic source of carbohydrate, but blood glucose also moves freely in and out of muscle cells as needed during sustained exercise.

This pool, however, is continually replenished during contraction, as described later, so that even when the muscle fatigues, ATP stores are only modestly decreased. Muscle cells contain creatine phosphate, which is used to convert ADP to ATP and thus replenish the ATP store during muscle contraction. The creatine phosphate store represents the immediate high-energy source for replenishing the ATP supply in skeletal muscle, especially during intense exercise.

The creatine phosphokinase in the thick filament may participate in the rapid resynthesis of", "although the accumulation of various metabolic products (lactate, Pi, ADP) has been implicated. In view of the importance of preventing depletion of myoplasmic ATP, which would affect the viability of the cell, it is likely that multiple mechanisms may have been developed to induce fatigue and hence lower the rate of ATP hydrolysis before the individual risks injury or death of the skeletal muscle cell. 11. When the energy demands of an exercising muscle cannot be met by oxidative metabolism, an oxygen debt is incurred. Increased breathing during the recovery period after exercise reflects this oxygen debt. The greater the reliance on anaerobic metabolism to meet the energy requirements of muscle contraction, the greater the oxygen debt. Gordon AM, Homsher E, Regnier M.

The regenerated ADP is then available to be used for another round of the phosphorylation reaction that forms ATP. The energetically favorable reaction of ATP hydrolysis is coupled to many otherwise unfavorable reactions through which other molecules are synthesized. Many of these coupled reactions involve the transfer of the terminal phosphate in ATP to another molecule, as illustrated by the phosphorylation reaction in Figure 2\u201334.

This decay represents the rapid and almost total failure of the fast motor units. The decline in force/stress is paralleled by depletion of glycogen and creatine phosphate stores and the accumulation of lactic acid. Of importance is that the decline in force/ stress occurs when the ATP pool is not greatly reduced, so that the muscle fibers do not go into rigor. In contrast, the slow motor units are able to meet the energy demands of fibers under this condition, and they do not exhibit significant fatigue, even after many hours.

Balance Between Energy Availability and Energy demand Release of phosphate from ATP provides every living cell with the energy required for life. However, the storage of ATP is only enough for 6 sec; therefore, ATP is constantly resynthesized. Although ATP can be resynthesized by anaerobic glycolysis, most of the energy used in the body is generated through aerobic metabolism. Therefore, energy consumption is usually estimated indirectly by oxygen consumption (indirect calorimetry). There is currently no method to measure true \u201cfitness,\u201d which is the maximal energy that can be produced by an organism over extended periods. Thus, fitness is estimated indirectly from peak oxygen consumption (MVo ), often during a maximal treadmill test. gressively with aging", "O2 consumption in the calculation of efficiency. The efficiency of the heart as a pump is relatively low. During physical exercise, efficiency improves because mean blood pressure does not change appreciably, whereas cardiac output and work increase considerably, without a proportional increase in myocardial O2 consumption. Of interest is that the chemical efficiency of the heart is rather high, as indicated by the estimate of 60% for the efficiency of generating ATP from oxidative phosphorylation. The energy expended in cardiac metabolism that does not contribute to the propulsion of blood through the body appears in the form of heat. The energy of flowing blood is also dissipated as heat.

In addition, some DNA segments\u2014a smaller number\u2014are transcribed into RNA molecules that are not translated but have catalytic, regulatory, or structural functions; such DNA segments also count as genes.

For convenience, the steps in this figure are depicted as occurring one at a time; in reality, many occur concurrently. For example, the RNA cap is added and splicing begins before transcription has been completed.

First, it takes time to make an mRNA molecule: the RNA polymerase must travel the length of the gene, the primary RNA transcript must be spliced and otherwise processed, and the resulting mRNA must be exported from the nucleus and delivered to the site where it will be translated. This adds up to what one might call the gestation time of the individual molecule.

The high variability of the splicing consensus sequences presents a special challenge for scientists attempting to decipher genome sequences.

Operons, however, are not found in eukaryotes, which must use alternate strategies to solve the problem of how to coordinately regulate all the genes required for a specific response.

These structures reflect significant protein synthetic and secretory functions. The scattered mitochondria are sufficient for oxidative phosphorylation to generate the increased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) consumed during contraction.

The sarcolemma regulates Ca++ influx and efflux from the extracellular Ca++ pool. The SR membranes determine Ca++ movement between the myoplasm and the SR pool.

Although it is possible to search genomes for splicing signals and other features that help to identify exons (codon bias, for example), one of the most powerful methods is simply to", "sequence variability; as we shall see shortly, the cell incorporates additional types of information to ultimately choose exactly where, on each RNA molecule, splicing is to take place. The high variability of the splicing consensus sequences presents a special challenge for scientists attempting to decipher genome sequences. Introns range in size from about 10 nucleotides to over 100,000 nucleotides, and choosing the precise borders of each intron is a difficult task even with the aid of powerful computers. The possibility of alternative splicing compounds the problem of predicting protein sequences solely from a genome sequence. This difficulty is one of the main barriers to identifying all of the genes in a complete genome sequence, and it is one of the primary reasons why we know only the approximate", "the last exon, so by the time the ribosome reaches it and stalls, no more EJCs will be bound to the mRNA. In this case, the mRNA \u201cpasses inspection\u201d and is released to the cytosol where it can be translated in earnest (Figure 6\u201376). However, if the ribosome reaches a stop codon earlier, when EJCs remain bound, the mRNA molecule is rapidly degraded. In this way, the first round of translation allows the cell to test the fitness of each mRNA molecule as it exits the nucleus. Nonsense-mediated decay may have been especially important in evolution, allowing eukaryotic cells to more easily explore new genes formed by DNA rearrangements, mutations, or alternative patterns of splicing\u2014by selecting only those mRNAs for translation that can produce a full-length protein. Nonsense-mediated", "exon\u2013 intron arrangement would seem to facilitate the emergence of new and useful proteins over evolutionary time scales. Thus, the presence of numerous introns in DNA allows genetic recombination to readily combine the exons of different genes, enabling genes for new proteins to evolve more easily by the combination of parts of preexisting genes. The observation, described in Chapter 3, that many proteins in present-day cells resemble patchworks composed from a common set of protein domains, supports this idea (see pp. 121\u2013122). RNA splicing also has a present-day advantage. The transcripts of many eukaryotic genes (estimated at 95% of genes in humans) are spliced in more than one way, thereby allowing the same gene to produce a corresponding set of dif-ferent proteins (Figure 6\u201326). Rather than being the", "different rates of evolution of exons and introns, as illustrated by comparing a portion of the mouse and human leptin genes.

These include portions of introns that lack splicing or regulatory signals, the third position in synonymous codons, and genes that have been irreversibly inactivated by mutation (the so-called pseudogenes). The clock runs most slowly for sequences that are subject to strong functional constraints\u2014for example, the amino acid sequences of proteins that engage in specific interactions with large numbers of other proteins and whose structure is therefore highly constrained, or the nucleotide sequences that encode the RNA subunits of the ribosome, on which all protein synthesis depends. Occasionally, rapid change is seen in a previously highly conserved sequence. As discussed later in this chapter, such episodes are especially interesting because they are thought to reflect periods", "two exons together while removing the intron between them as a \u201clariat\u201d (Figure 6\u201325). The machinery that catalyzes pre-mRNA splicing is complex, consisting of five addi-tional RNA molecules and several hundred proteins, and it hydrolyzes many ATP molecules per splicing event. This complexity ensures that splicing is accurate, while at the same time being flexible enough to deal with the enormous variety of introns found in a typical eukaryotic cell. It may seem wasteful to remove large numbers of introns by RNA splicing. In attempting to explain why it occurs, scientists have pointed out that the exon\u2013 intron arrangement would seem to facilitate the emergence of new and useful proteins over evolutionary time scales. Thus, the presence of numerous introns in DNA allows genetic recombination to readily combine", "the 64 possible three-base combinations, 61 code for the 20 standard amino acids and 3 signal termination of protein synthesis (translation). Altering the nucleotide sequence in a codon can cause silent mutations (the altered codon codes for the original amino acid), missense mutations (the altered codon codes for a different amino acid), or nonsense mutations (the altered codon is a termination codon). Characteristics of the genetic code include specificity, universality, and degeneracy, and it is nonoverlapping and commaless (Fig. 32.17). Requirements for protein synthesis include all the amino acids that eventually appear in the finished protein; at least one specific type of transfer RNA (tRNA) for each amino acid; one aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase for each amino acid; the mRNA coding for the protein to be synthesized; fully competent ribosomes", "that, compared with other steps in gene expression, splicing is unusually flexible. Thus, for example, a mutation in a nucleotide sequence critical for splicing of a particular intron does not necessarily prevent splicing of that intron altogether. Instead, the mutation typically creates a new pattern of splicing (Figure 6\u201333). Most commonly, an exon is simply skipped (Figure 6\u201333B). In other cases, the mutation causes a cryptic splice junction to be efficiently used (Figure 6\u201333C). Apparently, the splicing machinery has evolved to pick out the best possible pattern of splice junctions, and if the optimal one is damaged by mutation, it will seek out the next best pattern, and so on. This inherent plasticity in the process of RNA splicing suggests that changes in splicing patterns caused by random", "why so many of the alternative codons for an amino acid differ only in their third nucleotide (see Figure 6\u201348).

Access to DNA: In eukaryotes, DNA is found complexed with histone and nonhistone proteins to form chromatin (see p. 425). Transcriptionally active, decondensed chromatin (euchromatin) differs from the more condensed, inactive form (heterochromatin) in a number of ways. Active chromatin contains histone proteins that have been covalently modified at their amino terminal ends by reversible methylation, acetylation, or phosphorylation (see p. 438 for a discussion of histone acetylation/deacetylation by histone acetyltransferase and histone deacetylase). Such modifications decrease the positive charge of these basic proteins, thereby decreasing the", "typically result in chromatin condensation and transcriptional silencing.

A. Chromatin structure and gene expression The association of DNA with histones to form nucleosomes (see p. 425) affects the ability of the transcription machinery to access the DNA to be transcribed. Most actively transcribed genes are found in a relatively decondensed form of chromatin called euchromatin, whereas most inactive segments of DNA are found in highly condensed heterochromatin. The interconversion of these forms is called chromatin remodeling. A major component of chromatin remodeling is the covalent modification of histones (for example, the acetylation of lysine residues at the amino terminus of histone proteins), as shown in Figure 31.11. Acetylation, mediated by histone acetyltransferases (HAT), eliminates the positive charge on the lysine, thereby decreasing the interaction of the histone with the negatively charged DNA. Removal of the", "signals. In other cases, the altered chromatin structure persists, even after the transcription regulator that directed its establishment has dissociated from DNA. In principle, this memory can extend into the next cell generation because, as discussed in Chapter 4, chromatin structure can be self-renewing (see Figure 4\u201344). The fact that different histone modifications persist for different times provides the cell with a mechanism that makes possible both longerand shorter-term memory of gene expression patterns. A special type of chromatin modification occurs as RNA polymerase II transcribes through a gene. The histones just ahead of the polymerase can be acetylated by enzymes carried by the polymerase, removed by histone chaperones, and deposited behind the moving polymerase.

These transcription repressors can both depress the rate of transcription below the default value and rapidly shut off genes that were previously activated.

However, eukaryotic genes are rarely organized along the genome according to function, and this strategy is not generally applicable for shutting off a set of genes that work together.", "are reversible, with one enzyme serving to create a particular type of modification, and another to remove it. These enzymes are highly specific. Thus, for example, acetyl groups are added to specific lysines by a set of different histone acetyl transferases (HATs) and removed by a set of histone deacetylase complexes (HDACs). Likewise, methyl groups are added to lysine side chains by a set of different histone methyl transferases and removed by a set of histone demethylases. Each enzyme is recruited to specific sites on the chromatin at defined times in each cell\u2019s life history.

CpG islands in promoter regions are typically unmethylated, and the lack of methylation facilitates transcription.

When the energy demands of an exercising muscle cannot be met by oxidative metabolism, an oxygen debt is incurred.

The oxygen debt is much greater with strenuous exercise, when fast glycolytic motor units are used (Fig. 12.18 ).

This decay represents the rapid and almost total failure of the fast motor units.

As the light is reflected, some of its energy excites electrons in the gold coating and these excited electrons are affected by the electric field of any molecules binding to the surface of the glass coating.

CHAPTER SUMMARY Enzymes are protein catalysts that increase the velocity of a chemical reaction by lowering the energy of the transition state (Fig. 5.23). They are not consumed during the reaction. Enzyme molecules contain a special cleft called the active site, which contains amino acid side chains that participate in substrate binding and catalysis. The active site binds the substrate, forming an enzyme\u2013substrate (ES) complex. Binding is thought to cause a conformational change in the enzyme (induced fit) that allows catalysis. ES is converted to enzyme and product. An enzyme allows a reaction to proceed rapidly under conditions prevailing in the cell by providing an alternate reaction pathway with a lower activation energy (Ea). Because the", "is favorable. Energy is required to form this bond from NAD+, two electrons, and a proton (the same amount of energy that was released when the bond was broken). Therefore NAD+, the redox partner of NADH, is of necessity a weak electron acceptor. We can measure the tendency to transfer electrons from any redox pair experimentally. All that is required is the formation of an electrical circuit linking a 1:1 (equimolar) mixture of the redox pair to a second redox pair that has been arbitrarily selected as a reference standard, so that we can measure the voltage difference between them (Panel 14\u20131). This voltage difference is defined as the redox potential; electrons move spontaneously from a redox pair like NADH/NAD+ with a lower redox potential (a lower affinity", "quantum of visible light does not contain enough energy both to withdraw electrons from water, which holds on to its electrons very tightly (redox potential +820 mV) and therefore is a very poor electron donor, and to force them on to NADP+, which is a very poor electron acceptor (redox potential \u2013320 mV). The Z scheme first evolved in cyanobacteria to enable them to use water as a universally available electron source. Other, simpler photosynthetic bacteria have only one photosystem. As we shall see, they cannot use water as an electron source and must rely on other, more energy-rich substrates instead, from which electrons are more readily withdrawn. The ability to extract electrons from water (and thereby to produce molecular oxygen) was acquired by plants when their ancestors", "another, so that whenever one molecule is oxidized, another is reduced. As with any other chemical reaction, the tendency of such redox reactions to proceed spontaneously depends on the free-energy change (\u2206G) for the electron transfer, which in turn depends on the relative affinities of the two molecules for electrons. Because electron transfers provide most of the energy for life, it is worth taking the time to understand them. As discussed in Chapter 2, acids donate protons and bases accept them (see Panel 2\u20132, p. 93). Acids and bases exist in conjugate acid\u2013base pairs, in which the acid is readily converted into the base by the loss of a proton. For example, acetic acid (CH3COOH) is converted into its conjugate base, the acetate ion (CH3COO\u2013), in the reaction:", "of the standard free-energy change (\u2206G\u00b0) for the transfer of an electron from one molecule to another.

Conversely, those pairs that have the most positive redox potentials have the greatest affinity for electrons and therefore are useful as carriers with a strong tendency to accept electrons.

Of particular interest are the findings from studies of participants in the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease Risk Factor (KIHD) Study, an ongoing prospective population-based cohort study of health outcomes in more than 2,300 middle-aged men from eastern Finland, which identified strong links between sauna use and reduced death and disease\u2026 The KIHD findings showed that men who used the sauna two to three times per week were 27 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes than men who didn't use the sauna.[2] Furthermore, the benefits they experienced were found to be dose-dependent: Men who used the sauna roughly twice as often, about four to seven times per week, experienced roughly twice the benefits \u2013 and were 50 percent less likely to die from cardiovascular-related causes.[2] In addition, frequent sauna users were found to be 40 percent less likely to die from all causes of premature death. These findings held true even when considering age, activity levels, and lifestyle factors that might have influenced the men's health.[2]... The KIHD also revealed that frequent sauna use reduced the risk of developing dementia and Alzheimer's disease in a dose-dependent manner. Men who used the sauna two to three times per week had a 66 percent lower risk of developing dementia and a 65 percent lower risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, compared to men who used the sauna only one time per week\u2026 The health benefits associated with sauna use extended to other aspects of mental health, as well. Men participating in the KIHD study who used the sauna four to seven times per week were 77 percent less likely to develop psychotic disorders, regardless of the men's dietary habits, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and inflammatory status (as measured by C-reactive protein)\u2026Exposure to high temperature stresses the body, eliciting a rapid, robust response. The skin and core body temperatures increase markedly, and sweating ensues. The skin heats first, rising to 40\u00b0C (104\u00b0F), and then changes in core body temperature occur, rising slowly from 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F, or normal) to 38\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) and then rapidly increasing to 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F)\u2026  Cardiac output, a measure of the amount of work the heart performs in response to the body's need for oxygen, increases by 60 to 70 percent, while the heart rate (the number of beats per minute) increases and the stroke volume (the amount of blood pumped) remains unchanged.[5] During this time, approximately 50 to 70 percent of the body's blood flow is redistributed from the core to the skin to facilitate sweating. The average person loses approximately 0.5 kg of sweat while sauna bathing.[11] Acute heat exposure also induces a transient increase in overall plasma volume to mitigate the decrease in core blood volume. This increase in plasma volume not only provides a reserve source of fluid for sweating, but it also acts like the water in a car's radiator, cooling the body to prevent rapid increases in core body temperature and promoting heat tolerance\u2026 Repeated sauna use acclimates the body to heat and optimizes the body's response to future exposures, likely due to a biological phenomenon known as hormesis, a compensatory defense response following exposure to a mild stressor that is disproportionate to the magnitude of the stressor. Hormesis triggers a vast array of protective mechanisms that not only repair cell damage but also provide protection from subsequent exposures to more devastating stressors\u2026 The physiological responses to sauna use are remarkably similar to those experienced during moderate- to vigorous-intensity exercise.

PART 2 Cardinal Manifestations and Presentation of Diseases Although most patients with elevated body temperature have fever, there are circumstances in which elevated temperature represents not fever but hyperthermia (heat stroke). Hyperthermia is characterized by an uncontrolled increase in body temperature that exceeds the body\u2019s ability to lose heat. The setting of the hypothalamic thermoregulatory center is unchanged. In contrast to fever in infections, hyperthermia does not involve pyrogenic molecules. Exogenous heat exposure and endogenous heat production are two mechanisms by which hyperthermia can result in dangerously high internal temperatures. Excessive heat production can easily cause hyperthermia despite physiologic and behavioral control of body temperature. For example, work or exercise in hot environments can produce heat faster than peripheral mechanisms can lose it.", "The immediate defense of thermoneutrality is via the autonomic nervous system, whereas delayed control is mediated by the endocrine system. Autonomic nervous system responses include the release of norepinephrine, increased muscle tone, and shivering, leading to thermogenesis and an increase in the basal metabolic rate. Cutaneous cold thermoreception causes direct reflex vasoconstriction to conserve heat. Prolonged exposure to cold also stimulates the thyroid axis, leading to an increased metabolic rate. In most cases of hypothermia, the history of exposure to environmental factors (e.g., prolonged exposure to the outdoors without adequate clothing) makes the diagnosis straightforward. In urban settings, however, the presentation is often more subtle, and other disease processes, toxin exposures, or psychiatric diagnoses should be considered. After initial stimulation by hypothermia, there is progressive depression of all", "period of collapse, which is usually brief, equilibrium is spontaneously reestablished if the victim is able to rehydrate. Heat stroke is associated with high ambient temperatures and high humidity. Thermoregulatory mechanisms fail, sweating ceases, and core body temperature rises. In the clinical setting, a rectal temperature of 106\u00b0F or higher is considered a grave prognostic sign, and the mortality rate for such patients exceeds 50%. The underlying mechanism is marked generalized peripheral vasodilation with peripheral pooling of blood and a decreased effective circulating blood volume. Necrosis of the muscles and myocardium may occur. Arrhythmias, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and other systemic effects are common.

Elderly people, persons with cardiovascular disease, and otherwise healthy people undergoing physical stress (such as young athletes and military recruits) are prime candidates for heat stroke. \u2022 Malignant hyperthermia, although similar sounding, is not caused by exposure to high temperatures. It is a genetic condition resulting from mutations in genes such as RYR1 that control calcium levels in skeletal muscle cells. In affected individuals, exposure to certain anesthetics during surgery may trigger a rapid rise in calcium levels in skeletal muscle, which in turn leads to muscle rigidity and increased heat production. The resulting hyperthermia has a mortality rate of approximately 80% if untreated, but this falls to less than 5% if the condition is recognized and muscle relaxants are administered", "ejection of blood by the left ventricle and diminished peripheral runoff during the brief ventricular ejection period (see also During exhaustive exercise, the compensatory mechanisms begin to fail. The heart rate attains a maximal level of approximately 180 beats per minute, and stroke volume reaches a plateau. The heart rate may then decrease, which results in a fall in blood pressure. The exercising individual also frequently becomes dehydrated. Sympathetic vasoconstrictor activity supersedes the vasodilator influence on vessels of the skin so that the rate of heat loss is decreased. Body temperature is normally elevated during exercise. A reduction in heat loss through cutaneous vasoconstriction can lead to very high body temperatures and to acute distress during severe exercise.

Lack of sweating after a hot bath, during exercise, or on a hot day can suggest sudomotor failure. OH (also called orthostatic or postural hypotension) is perhaps the most disabling feature of autonomic dysfunction. The prevalence of OH is relatively high, especially when OH associated with aging and diabetes mellitus is included (Table 454-4). OH can cause a variety of symptoms, including dimming or loss of vision, lightheadedness, diaphoresis, diminished hearing, pallor, and weakness. Syncope results when the drop in BP impairs cerebral perfusion. Other manifestations of impaired baroreflexes are supine hypertension, a heart rate that is fixed regardless of posture, postprandial hypotension, and an excessively high nocturnal BP.

In normal persons, immersing one hand in ice water for 1 to 5 min raises the systolic pressure by 15 to 20 mm Hg and the diastolic pressure by 10 to 15 mm Hg. Similarly, the sustained isometric contraction of a group of muscles (e.g., those of the forearm in handgrip) for 5 min normally increases the heart rate and the systolic and diastolic pressures by at least 15 mm Hg.

In acute myocardial infarction associated with low cardiac output, hypothermia may be reversed after adequate resuscitation.

This underscores the fact that skeletal muscle, despite its potential for transient periods of anaerobic glycolysis, is an oxidative tissue. A. Carbohydrate metabolism 1. Increased glucose transport: The transient increase in plasma glucose and insulin after a carbohydrate-rich meal leads to an increase in glucose transport into muscle cells (myocytes) by GLUT-4 (see p. 97 and Fig. 24.7, ), thereby reducing blood glucose. Glucose is phosphorylated to glucose 6-phosphate by hexokinase and metabolized to meet the energy needs of myocytes. 2. Increased glycogenesis: The increased insulin/glucagon ratio and the availability of glucose 6-phosphate favor glycogen synthesis, particularly if", "lowering plasma glucose (during and following exercise) and increasing insulin sensitivity. In patients with diabetes, the ADA recommends 150 min/week (distributed over at least 3 days) of moderate aerobic physical activity with no gaps longer than 2 days. The exercise regimen should also include resistance training. Despite its benefits, exercise presents challenges for individuals with DM because they lack the normal glucoregulatory mechanisms (normally, insulin falls and glucagon rises during exercise). Skeletal muscle is a major site for metabolic fuel consumption in the resting state, and the increased muscle activity during vigorous, aerobic exercise greatly increases fuel requirements. Individuals with type 1 DM are prone to either hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia during exercise, depending on the preexercise plasma glucose, the circulating insulin level, and the level of exercise-induced catecholamines.", "Blood is then obtained at intervals of 1, 2, 4, 6, and 10 min for comparison with the baseline sample. A threeto fourfold rise of lactic acid is typical. The simultaneous measurement of ammonia serves as a control, because it should also rise with exercise. In patients with myophosphorylase deficiency or other glycolytic defects, the lactic acid rise will be absent or below normal, while the rise in ammonia will reach control values. If there is lack of effort, neither lactic acid nor ammonia will rise. Patients with selective failure to increase ammonia may have myoadenylate deaminase deficiency. This condition has been reported to be a cause of myoglobinuria, but deficiency of this enzyme in asymptomatic individuals makes interpretation controversial.

This decay represents the rapid and almost total failure of the fast motor units. The decline in force/stress is paralleled by depletion of glycogen and creatine phosphate stores and the accumulation of lactic acid. Of importance is that the decline in force/ stress occurs when the ATP pool is not greatly reduced, so that the muscle fibers do not go into rigor. In contrast, the slow motor units are able to meet the energy demands of fibers under this condition, and they do not exhibit significant fatigue, even after many hours.

Because the addition of water is not easily controlled and the loss by evaporation cannot be controlled, the only way to maintain a constant level of the lake is to regulate the amount that is lost through the spillways.

As electrons are passed down the ETC, they lose much of their free energy. This energy is used to move H+ across the inner mitochondrial membrane, creating a H+ gradient that drives the production of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi), described on p. 77.

The consideration of lyonization must begin with Mary Lyon, who in 1962 proposed that in females, only one X chromosome is genetically active. X inactivation occurs early in fetal life, about 16 days after conception. Either the paternal or the maternal X chromosome is randomly inactivated in each cell of the developing embryo. Once inactivated, the same X chromosome remains inactive in all of the progeny of these cells. Moreover, all but one X chromosome is inactivated, and so a 48,XXXX female has only one active X chromosome. This phenomenon explains why normal females do not have a double dose (compared with males) of phenotypic attributes encoded on the X chromosome.

By age 25, approximately 0.4 percent of the population exhibits an abnormality attributed to a monogenic disorder, and 2 percent will have at least one such disorder during their lifetime (Table 13-3).

Finally, unlike DNA polymerases, which make their products in segments that are later stitched together, RNA polymerases are absolutely processive; that is, the same RNA polymerase that begins an RNA molecule must finish it without dissociating from the DNA template.

They also fatigue rapidly as a result of production of lactic acid. Thus, type IIb fibers are adapted for rapid contraction and precise, fine movements. They constitute most fibers of the extraocular muscles and the muscles that control the movements of the digits.

Differences in patterns of vascular supply may permit some muscles to withstand the effects of vascular occlusion better than others.

In fact, the role played by financial incentives in medical decision-making may often be dwarfed by the roles played by scientific knowledge, by professional norms and ethics, and by the influence of peers. However, economic policy greatly influences financial incentives, and economists tend to focus on this domain. Their interest stems from fundamental economic questions: What goods and services are produced and consumed? In particular, how much medical care is available, and how much of other goods and services? How is medical care produced? For example, what mix of specific services is used in treating a particular episode of illness? Who receives particular treatments? Physicians in all societies live and function in economic markets, although those markets differ greatly both from the simple competitive markets", "obtain such benefits. However, avoiding deception is a basic ethical guideline that sets limits on advocating for patients. Allocation of health care resources is unavoidable because these resources are limited. Ideally, decisions about allocation are made at the level of public policy, with physician input. For example, the United Network for Organ Sharing (www.unos.org) provides criteria for allocating scarce organs. Ad hoc resource allocation at the bedside is problematic because it may be inconsistent, unfair, and ineffective. Physicians have an important role, however, in avoiding unnecessary interventions. Evidence-based lists of tests and procedures that physicians and patients should question and discuss were developed through the recent initiative Choosing Wisely (http://www.choosingwisely.org/). At the bedside, physicians should act as patient advocates within constraints set by society, reasonable insurance coverage, and", "information about incremental cost, the set price could be, and often is, far from the actual cost. If the regulator sets the price below cost, the service may not be available or, if it is, will have to be cross-subsidized from a profitable service. If the price is set above cost, there may well be excess entry and too many services being offered on too small a scale. A beneficent regulator in theory could approximate a competitive price by trial and error if technology did not change, but that condition clearly does not hold in medical care. Not only do new goods and services appear continually, but physicians often become more skilled at delivering a service that is already available or at developing new tools to deliver that", "of the health care team.

Another initiative developed at Rand and the University of California\u2013Los Angeles is the PREPARED checklist for informed, collaborative choice (Table 3.3) . Studies show that greater patient (and family) involvement in health care decision making results in improved satisfaction and better outcomes (55).

To discourage volume-based excessive utilization, fixed salary compensation plans pay physicians the same regardless of the clinical effort expended, but may provide an incentive to see fewer patients. Despite the great technological advances in medicine over the last century, uncertainty remains a key challenge in all aspects of medical decision-making. Compounding this challenge is the massive information overload that characterizes modern medicine. Today\u2019s clinician needs access to close to 2 million pieces of information to practice medicine. According to one estimate, doctors subscribe to an average of seven journals, representing over 2500 new articles each year. Of course, to be useful, this information must be sifted for applicability to and then integrated with patient-specific data.

The thin ascending limb reabsorbs NaCl by a passive mechanism. Reabsorption of water, but not NaCl, in the descending thin limb increases [NaCl] in the tubule fluid entering the ascending thin limb. As the NaCl-rich fluid moves toward the cortex, NaCl diffuses out of the tubule lumen across the ascending thin limb and into the medullary interstitial fluid, down a concentration gradient directed from the tubule fluid to the interstitium (see for details). The key element in reabsorption of solute by the thick ascending limb is Na+,K+-ATPase in the basolateral membrane (Fig. 34.7 ).

Salt reabsorption in the TAL therefore dilutes the tubular fluid, and for this reason, the TAL is called a diluting segment. Medullary portions of the TAL contribute to medullary hypertonicity and thereby also play an important role in concentration of urine by the collecting duct. The NaCl transport system in the luminal membrane of the TAL is a Na+/K+/2Cl\u2212 cotransporter (called NKCC2 or NK2CL) (Figure 15\u20133). This transporter is selectively blocked by diuretic agents known as \u201cloop\u201d diuretics (discussed later in chapter).
