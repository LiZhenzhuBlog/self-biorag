The DNA replicates in interphase, beginning at the origins of replication and proceeding bidirectionally from the origins across the chromosome. In m phase, the centromere attaches the duplicated chromosomes to the mitotic spindle so that a copy of the entire genome is distributed to each daughter cell during mitosis; the special structure that attaches the centromere to the spindle is a protein complex called the kinetochore (dark green). The centromere also helps to hold the duplicated chromosomes together until they are ready to be moved apart. The telomeres form special caps at each chromosome end.

FISH permits determination of the number and location of specific DNA sequences in human cells. FISH can be performed on metaphase chromosomes, as with G-banding, but can also be performed on cells not actively progressing through mitosis. FISH performed on nondividing cells is referred to as interphase or nuclear FISH (Fig. 83e-2).

Heterozygous women have diminished factor VIII levels, but almost invariably, the homozygous state is requisite for hemophilia A.

Somatic hypermutation involves both mutation at the original cytidines targeted by AID and mutation at nearby non-cytidine nucleotides.

DNA methylation in vertebrate DNA occurs on cytosine (C) nucleotides largely in the sequence CG, which is base-paired to exactly the same sequence (in opposite orientation) on the other strand of the DNA helix. Consequently, a simple mechanism permits the existing pattern of DNA methylation to be inherited directly by the daughter DNA strands.

If the nucleotide listed in the first column is present at the third, or wobble, position of the codon, it can base-pair with any of the nucleotides listed in the second column. Thus, for example, when inosine (I) is present in the wobble position of the tRNA anticodon, the tRNA can recognize any one of three different codons in bacteria and either of two codons in eukaryotes. The inosine in tRNAs is formed from the deamination of adenosine (see Figure 6\u201353),", "of two high-energy bonds are used to drive the addition of each deoxynucleotide.

When a child is affected with the new onset of an AD disorder, it is necessary to closely examine the parents to check for the presence of manifestations.

About 65% of human monogenic disorders are autosomal dominant, 25% are autosomal recessive, and 5% are X-linked. Genetic testing is now available for many of these disorders and plays an increasingly important role in clinical medicine (Chap. 84). autosomal Dominant DisorDers These disorders assume particular relevance because mutations in a single allele are sufficient to cause the disease. In contrast to recessive disorders, in which disease pathogenesis is relatively straightforward because there is loss of gene function, dominant disorders can be caused by various disease mechanisms, many of which are unique to the function of the genetic pathway involved. In autosomal dominant disorders, individuals are affected in successive generations; the disease does not occur in the", "or mendelian disorder is caused by a mutation or alteration in a single locus or gene in one or both members of a gene pair. Types of mendelian inheritance include autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked, and Y-linked. Other monogenic inheritance patterns, described subsequently, include mitochondrial inheritance, uniparental disomy, imprinting, and trinucleotide repeat expansion-also termed anticipation. By age 25, approximately 0.4 percent of the population exhibits an abnormality attributed to a monogenic disorder, and 2 percent will have at least one such disorder during their lifetime (Table 13-3). When considering inheritance, it is the phenotype that is dominant or recessive, not the genotype. With a dominant disease, the normal gene may direct the production of normal protein, but the phenotype is abnormal because it is determined by protein produced", "parents. In this situation, there is a 25% chance that the offspring will have a normal genotype, a 50% probability of a heterozygous state, and a 25% risk of homozygosity for the recessive alleles (Figs. 82-10, 82-13B). In the case of one unaffected heterozygous and one affected homozygous parent, the probability of disease increases to 50% for each child. In this instance, the pedigree analysis mimics an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance (pseudodominance). In contrast to autosomal dominant disorders, new mutations in recessive alleles are rarely manifest because they usually result in an asymptomatic carrier state. x-linkeD DisorDers Males have only one X chromosome; consequently, a daughter always inherits her father\u2019s X chromosome in addition to one of her mother\u2019s two X chromosomes.

In autosomal dominant disorders, individuals are affected in successive generations; the disease does not occur in the offspring of unaffected individuals. Males and females are affected with equal frequency because the defective gene resides on one of the 22 autosomes (Fig. 82-13A). Autosomal dominant mutations alter one of the two alleles at a given locus. Because the alleles segregate randomly at meiosis, the probability that an offspring will be affected is 50%. Unless there is a new germline mutation, an affected individual has an affected parent. Children with a normal genotype do not transmit the disorder.

Malignant hyperthermia is an allelic condition; C-terminal mutations of the RYR1 gene predispose to this complication. Specific treatment is not required, but establishing a diagnosis of central core disease is extremely important because these patients have a known predisposition to malignant hyperthermia during anesthesia.

Because of these variations, it is sometimes challenging to determine the pattern of inheritance. It should be recognized, however, that some individuals acquire a mutated gene from an unaffected parent. De novo germline mutations occur more frequently during later cell divisions in gametogenesis, which explains why siblings are rarely affected. As noted before, new germline mutations occur more frequently in fathers of advanced age.

This effort (called the Human Genome Project and completed in 2003) was made possible by several tools that have already contributed to our understanding of many genetic diseases (Fig. 34.1). These include 1) the discovery of restriction endonucleases that permit the cleavage of huge DNA molecules into defined fragments, 2) the development of cloning techniques that provide a mechanism for amplification of specific nucleotide sequences, and 3) the ability to synthesize specific probes, which has allowed the identification and manipulation of nucleotide sequences of interest.

These sequence variations include variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs), short tandem repeats (STRs), and SNPs. Most STRs, also called polymorphic microsatellite markers, consist of di-, tri-, or tetranucleotide repeats that can be characterized readily using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

Newer types of \u201cSNP chips\u201d are based on a similar concept, but the probes are designed to identify SNP sites genomewide, which has a number of advantages over CGH. As discussed in Chapter 1, SNPs are the most common type of DNA polymorphism, occurring approximately every 1000 nucleotides throughout the genome (e.g., in exons, introns, and regulatory sequences). Thus, SNPs serve both as a physical landmark within the genome as well as a genetic marker whose transmission can be followed from parent to child.

In array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), the test DNA and a reference (normal) DNA are labeled with two different fluorescent dyes that fluoresce red and green, respectively.

In some animals, including humans, the survival of multiple, dependent offspring is beyond the capacity and resources of a single parent. In this situation, the presence of a long-lived grandmother who shares in the care of her grandchildren can have a major impact on their survival.

For example, in a hostile environment, survival is highest for those species that have large numbers of offspring and short lifespan, whereas in a safe and abundant environment, survival is highest for those species that invest resources in a smaller number of offspring and a longer life.

Identification of Molecular Pathology If the molecular basis of an inborn error of metabolism is known (i.e., the gene or genes have been mapped and mutations defined), specific genetic testing may be clinically available. In some disorders, there is a good correlation between specific mutations and clinical outcome. Genetic testing in other at-risk family members can provide important genetic information for them, enabling decision making throughout the rest of the family.

Currently, enzyme replacement therapy is being tried as a method for reducing circulating phenylalanine levels in patients with classic PKU. The replacement enzyme, known as phenylalanine ammonia lyase (or PAL), converts excess phenylalanine to ammonia and other nontoxic metabolites. Although 98% of cases of hyperphenylalaninemia are attributable to mutations in PAH, approximately 2% arise from abnormalities in synthesis or recycling of the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin ( Fig. 7.7 ). Clinical recognition of these variant forms is important because these patients cannot be treated by dietary restriction of phenylalanine alone, but also require supplementation with tetrahydrobiopterin, certain neurotransmitter precursors, and folic acid. http://ebooksmedicine.net Fig. 7.7 Thephenylalaninehydroxylasesystem.NADH,", "is designed to maintain plasma phenylalanine values in the therapeutic range of 120 to 360 mM using a diet specifically restricted in phenylalanine but otherwise nutritionally complete.

Thus, for example, a mutation in a nucleotide sequence critical for splicing of a particular intron does not necessarily prevent splicing of that intron altogether. Instead, the mutation typically creates a new pattern of splicing (Figure 6\u201333). Most commonly, an exon is simply skipped (Figure 6\u201333B). In other cases, the mutation causes a cryptic splice junction to be efficiently used (Figure 6\u201333C).

The current paradigm states that the genes mutated in familial syndromes can also be targets for somatic mutations in sporadic (noninherited) tumors.

Thus, most cells of an individual with an inherited loss-of-function mutation in a tumor-suppressor gene are functionally normal, and only the rare cells that develop a mutation in the remaining normal allele will exhibit uncontrolled regulation.

Similarly, a rare genetic disease known as ataxia telangiectasia is caused by a defect in ATM, one of the protein kinases that are activated in response to x-ray-induced DNA damage; patients with this disease are very sensitive to x-rays and suffer from increased rates of cancer. What happens if DNA damage is so severe that repair is not possible? The answer differs in different organisms. Unicellular organisms such as budding yeast arrest their cell cycle to try to repair the damage, but the cycle resumes even if the repair cannot be completed. For a single-celled organism, life with mutations is apparently better than no life at all.

Cancer treatment itself does not appear to be responsible for the risk of these secondary malignancies. Deficient DNA repair can greatly increase the risk of cancers from DNA-damaging agents, as in ataxia-telangiectasia. Importantly, the risk of treatment-related second malignancies is at least additive and often synergistic with combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and hence for such combined-therapy treatment approaches, it is important to establish the necessity of each in the treatment program.

CHAPTER SUMMARY Hemoglobin A (HbA), the major hemoglobin in adults, is composed of four polypeptide chains (two \u03b1 chains and two \u03b2 chains, \u03b12\u03b22) held together by noncovalent interactions (Fig. 3.25). The subunits occupy different relative positions in deoxyhemoglobin compared with", "higher oxygen affinity. Carbon monoxide (CO) binds tightly (but reversibly) to the Hb iron, forming carboxyhemoglobin. Hemoglobinopathies are disorders primarily caused either by production of a structurally abnormal Hb molecule as in sickle cell anemia or synthesis of insufficient quantities of normal Hb subunits as in the thalassemias (Fig. 3.26). Choose the ONE best answer. .1. Which one of the following statements concerning the hemoglobins is correct? A. HbA is the most abundant hemoglobin in normal adults. B. Fetal blood has a lower affinity for oxygen than does adult blood because HbF has an increased affinity for 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. C. The globin chain composition of HbF is \u03b12\u03b42. D. HbA1c differs from HbA by a single, genetically determined amino acid substitution. E. HbA2 appears early in fetal life. Correct", "for 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate. C. The globin chain composition of HbF is \u03b12\u03b42. D. HbA1c differs from HbA by a single, genetically determined amino acid substitution. E. HbA2 appears early in fetal life. Correct answer = A. HbA accounts for over 90% of the hemoglobin in a normal adult. If HbA1c is included, the percentage rises to ~97%. Because 2,3bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) reduces the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen, the weaker interaction between 2,3-BPG and HbF results in a higher oxygen affinity for HbF relative to HbA. HbF consists of \u03b12\u03b32. HbA1c is a glycated form of HbA, formed nonenzymically in red blood cells. HbA2 is a minor component of normal adult hemoglobin, first appearing shortly before birth and rising to adult levels (~2% of the total hemoglobin) by age 6", "to produce globin chains. These are called pseudogenes.] B. \u03b2-Gene family A single gene for the \u03b2-globin chain is located on chromosome 11 (see Fig. 3.17). There are an additional four \u03b2-globin-like genes: the \u03b5 gene (which, like the \u03b6 gene, is expressed early in embryonic development), two \u03b3 genes (G\u03b3 and A\u03b3 that are expressed in HbF), and the \u03b4 gene that codes for the globin chain found in the minor adult hemoglobin HbA2. C. Steps in globin chain synthesis Expression of a globin gene begins in the nucleus of RBC precursors, where the DNA sequence encoding the gene is transcribed. The ribonucleic acid (RNA) produced by transcription is actually a precursor of the messenger RNA (mRNA) that is used as a template for the synthesis of", "to those found in HbA, plus two \u03b3 chains (\u03b12\u03b32; see Fig. 3.14). The \u03b3 chains are members of the \u03b2-globin gene family (see p. 34). a. HbF synthesis during development: In the first month after conception, embryonic hemoglobins such as Hb Gower 1, composed of two \u03b1-like zeta (\u03b6) chains and two \u03b2-like epsilon (\u03b5) chains (\u03b62\u03b52), are synthesized by the embryonic yolk sac. In the fifth week of gestation, the site of globin synthesis shifts, first to the liver and then to the marrow, and the primary product is HbF. HbF is the major hemoglobin found in the fetus and newborn, accounting for ~60% of the total hemoglobin in the RBC during the last months of fetal life (Fig. 3.15). HbA synthesis starts in the bone", "hemoglobin and thus helps in the transfer of oxygen from the mother to the fetus. The gene for the new \u03b2-like chain subsequently duplicated and mutated again to produce two new genes, \u03b5 and \u03b3, the \u03b5 chain being produced earlier in development (to form \u03b12\u03b52) than the fetal \u03b3 chain, which forms \u03b12\u03b32. A duplication of the adult \u03b2-chain gene occurred still later, during primate evolution, to give rise to a \u03b4-globin gene and thus to a minor form of hemoglobin (\u03b12\u03b42) that is found only in adult primates (Figure 4\u201376). Each of these duplicated genes has been modified by point mutations that affect the properties of the final hemoglobin molecule, as well as by changes in regulatory regions that determine the timing and level of expression", "genes has been modified by point mutations that affect the properties of the final hemoglobin molecule, as well as by changes in regulatory regions that determine the timing and level of expression of the gene. Figure 4\u201376 An evolutionary scheme for the globin chains that carry oxygen in the blood of animals. The scheme emphasizes the \u03b2-like globin gene family. A relatively recent gene duplication of the \u03b3-chain gene produced \u03b3g and \u03b3A, which are fetal \u03b2-like chains of identical function. The location of the globin genes in the human genome is shown at the top of the figure. As a result, each globin is made in different amounts at different times of human development. The history of these gene duplications is reflected in the arrangement of hemoglobin", "right). The other choices decrease the affinity for O2, stabilize the T (tense) or deoxygenated form, and cause a right shift in the curve. HbA2 and fetal Hb (HbF) do not contain \u03b2 globin. As \u03b2 globin production decreases, synthesis of HbA2 (\u03b12\u03b42) and HbF (\u03b12\u03b32) increases. Sickle cell anemia is caused by a single point mutation (A\u2192T) in the gene for \u03b2 globin that results in the replacement of glutamate by valine at the sixth amino acid position in the protein. Mutational analysis using allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) probes for that mutation (\u03b2S) and for the normal sequence (\u03b2A) is used in diagnosis (see figure at lower right). \u03b2-Thalassemia, in contrast, is caused by hundreds of different mutations. Mutational analysis using ASO probes can assess common mutations, including", "with the added complication that the HbH molecule behaves like moderately unstable hemoglobin. Patients with HbH disease should undergo splenectomy if excessive anemia or a transfusion requirement develops. Oxidative drugs should be avoided. Iron overload leading to death can occur in more severely affected patients. Antenatal diagnosis of thalassemia syndromes is now widely available. DNA diagnosis is based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of fetal DNA, obtained by amniocentesis or chorionic villus biopsy followed by hybridization to allele-specific oligonucleotide probes or direct DNA sequencing. Thalassemic structural variants are characterized by both defective synthesis and abnormal structure. Hb Lepore [\u03b12(\u03b4\u03b2)2] arises by an unequal crossover and recombination event that fuses the proximal end of the \u03b4-gene with the distal end of the closely linked \u03b2-gene.

It is common in the Mediterranean basin. The resulting chromosome contains only the fused \u03b4\u03b2 gene. The Lepore (\u03b4\u03b2) globin is synthesized poorly because the fused gene is under the control of the weak \u03b4-globin promoter. Hb Lepore alleles have a phenotype like \u03b2 thalassemia, except for the added presence of 2\u201320% Hb Lepore. Compound heterozygotes for Hb Lepore and a classic \u03b2 thalassemia allele may also have severe thalassemia.

Schizophrenia generally presents in adolescence or early adulthood. The same diagnostic criteria are applied as in adults but must be interpreted in terms of the developmental stage of the child (Table 20-3). Childhood-onset schizophrenia is a rare disorder (<1 in 10,000 children) and usually indicates a more severe form of schizophrenia. The frequency increases between 13 and 18 years of age. Boys tend to be affected about twice as often as girls, regardless of ethnic or other cultural factors. The etiology of schizophrenia is unknown.

It has been estimated, using various genetic techniques, that as much as 40 percent of the risk of depression is heritable (lower than for schizophrenia and bipolar disease). Adopted children whose biologic parents had affective disorder are at greater risk of developing this disease than are adoptees whose biologic parents were not affected (Mendlewicz and Rainer; Cadoret). The frequency of these illnesses is greatly increased in the relatives of affected patients (prevalence rate of 14 to 25 percent in first-degree relatives).

It is unclear whether indigent status is a precipitating stress or a result of psychotic illness, but, especially as extremely few individuals have private or public coverage for adequate treatment, most people with schizophrenia are indigent. Assessment There is wide variability in the functional impact of psychotic disorders. Patients must not be assumed to be incompetent to make medical decisions or lead independent lives, especially if they comply with treatment. Patients must be asked specifically about their living situations and coping skills.

The notion that psychosocial factors play an important role in the genesis of schizophrenia was a recurrent theme in older psychiatric writings, but is now given less credence. Prominent in these early writings was Freud\u2019s view that the schizophrenic process represents a fixation at an early autoerotic stage of sexual development. There is no way of affirming or refuting this proposition. The same can be said for the many suggestions that disturbed intrafamily relationships engender schizophrenic traits or possibly provoke psychosis in persons who are genetically vulnerable. Behind all these suggestions was the notion that disturbed interpersonal relations in the family in some way interfered with the normal maturation of personality.

Behind all these suggestions was the notion that disturbed interpersonal relations in the family in some way interfered with the normal maturation of personality. The extent to which these aberrations of family relationships are primary or secondary cannot be ascertained. The often-cited observations of Harlow on the deleterious effects of maternal and peer deprivation in primates opened the possibility that similar deprivations in humans may be responsible for the development of schizophrenia. However, such severe degrees of familial deprivation have rarely been documented in humans and when they were, as in some orphans, the effects were only transitory.

These individuals feel so unable to func- tion alone that they will agree with things that they feel are wrong rather than risk losing the help of those to whom they look for guidance. They do not get appropriately angry at others whose support and nurturance they need for fear of alienating them.

Variables that are predictive of an unfavorable outcome are high degrees of anxiety, strongly positive family history of a similar psychiatric illness, and presence of depression-provoking circumstances (Hirschfeld et al).

Direct diagnosis of sickle cell anemia using RFLP: The genetic disorders of Hb are the most common genetic diseases in humans. In the case of sickle cell anemia (Fig. 34.17), the point mutation that gives rise to the disease (see p. 35) is actually one and the same mutation that gives rise to the polymorphism. However, direct detection by RFLP of diseases that result from point mutations is limited to only a few genetic diseases. a. Early diagnostic efforts: In the past, prenatal diagnosis of sickle cell anemia involved the determination of the amount and kinds of Hb synthesized in the nucleated red cells obtained from fetal blood.

The mutation in the \u03b2-globin chain of hemoglobin giving rise to sickle cell anemia is an excellent example of a point mutation that alters the meaning of the genetic code. Such mutations are sometimes called missense mutations. By contrast, certain point mutations may change an amino acid codon to a chain termination codon, or a stop codon. Such \u201cnonsense\u201d mutations interrupt translation, and in most cases RNAs are rapidly degraded, a phenomenon called nonsense mediated decay, such that little or no protein is formed.

For example, heterozygotes for the sickle cell gene are less susceptible to the severe malaria caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum. This organism spends an obligatory part of its life cycle in the RBC. One theory is that because these cells in individuals heterozygous for HbS, like those in homozygotes, have a shorter life span than normal, the parasite cannot complete the intracellular stage of its development. This may provide a selective advantage to heterozygotes living in regions where malaria is a major cause of death. For example, in Africa, the geographic distribution of sickle cell anemia is similar to", "protein, the final gene product, may be used to construct a nucleic acid probe using the genetic code as a guide.

In contrast, cDNA probes contain many thousands of bases, and their binding to a target DNA with a single-base change is unaffected.] 1.

The clinical features of TS result from haploinsufficiency of multiple X chromosomal genes (e.g., short stature homeobox, SHOX). However, imprinted genes also may be affected when the inherited X has different parental origins. Clinical Features TS is characterized by bilateral streak gonads, primary amenorrhea, short stature, and multiple congenital anomalies in phenotypic females. It affects ~1 in 2500 women and is diagnosed at different ages depending on the dominant clinical features (Table 410-2).

Of note, whatever the number of X chromosomes, the presence of a Y invariably dictates the male phenotype.

Described briefly next are two disorders, Klinefelter syndrome and Turner syndrome, that result from aberrations of sex chromosomes. Klinefelter syndrome is defined as male hypogonadism that develops when there are at least two X chromosomes and one or more Y chromosomes. It is the most common cause of hypogonadism in males.

Differences of body plan seem to arise to a large extent from differences in the regulatory DNA associated with each gene.

This polymerase requires five general transcription factors (27 subunits in toto; see Table 6\u20133, p. 311), in contrast to bacterial RNA polymerase, which needs only a single general transcription factor (the \u03c3 subunit). As we have seen, the stepwise assembly of the general transcription factors at a eukaryotic promoter provides, in principle, multiple steps at which the cell can speed up or slow down the rate of transcription initiation in response to transcription regulators.

The DNA sequences of individual bacterial promoters differ in ways that determine their strength (the number of initiation events per unit time of the promoter).

All these biological enterprises are linked, because the genetic information of all living organisms is written in the same language. The new-found ability of molecular biologists to read and decipher this language has already begun to transform our relationship to the living world.

Regulatory factors also bind within the gene itself, particularly in the intronic regions. The transcription factors that bind to DNA actually represent only the first level of regulatory control.

This effort (called the Human Genome Project and completed in 2003) was made possible by several tools that have already contributed to our understanding of many genetic diseases (Fig. 34.1). These include 1) the discovery of restriction endonucleases that permit the cleavage of huge DNA molecules into defined fragments, 2) the development of cloning techniques that provide a mechanism for amplification of specific nucleotide sequences, and 3) the ability to synthesize specific probes, which has allowed the identification and manipulation of nucleotide sequences of interest.

The analysis of complex disorders is further complicated by ethnic differences in disease prevalence, differences in allele frequencies in known susceptibility genes among different populations, locus and allelic heterogeneity, gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, and the possibility of phenocopies.

In addition to introns and exons, each gene is associated with regulatory DNA sequences, which are responsible for ensuring that the gene is turned on or off at the proper time, expressed at the appropriate level, and only in the proper type of cell. In humans, the regulatory sequences for a typical gene are spread out over tens of thousands of nucleotide pairs.

For those mutations that do become fixed, the mathematics shows that the average time to fixation is approximately 4N generations. Detailed analyses of data on human genetic variation have suggested an ancestral population size of approximately 10,000 at the time when the current pattern of genetic variation was largely established. With a population that has reached this size, the probability that a new, selectively neutral mutation would become fixed is small (1/20,000), while the average time to fixation would be on the order of 800,000 years (assuming a 20-year generation time).

In most cases, there is presumed to be little or no selection\u2014at least initially\u2014to maintain the duplicated state since either copy can provide an equivalent function.

In this section, we discuss broadly how genes are identified in genome sequences and what clues we can discern about their roles from simply inspecting their sequences.

The first step is usually to translate in silico the entire genome into protein. There are six different reading frames for any piece of double-stranded DNA (three on each strand).

For proteins that are not rapidly turned over, the response time is very long, and protein concentration is determined primarily by the dilution that results from cell growth and division.

Only identical twins can accept grafts from one another, without fear of rejection. Even grafts from a donor to a sibling with the same HLA haplotype", "common for relatives to mate. This relatedness or consanguinity does not increase the likelihood of offspring having any particular single genetic disorder, but it may increase the chance that a child will be born with a rare autosomal recessive (AR) condition, as the mutated gene segregates through that family. Generally, the closer the relation between the partners, the greater the chance that the couple shares one or more mutated genes in common, increasing the risk that offspring will have an AR disorder. The risk of first cousins producing a child with an AR disorder is 1 in 64. In evaluating these couples, it is important to determine which ethnic group they belong to and to test for conditions commonly found in that group. It is common for couples", "offspring that receive one of four possible combinations of the parental MHC haplotypes. Thus siblings are also likely to differ in the MHC alleles they express, there being one chance in four that an individual will share both haplotypes with a sibling. One consequence of this is the difficulty of finding suitable donors for tissue transplantation, even among siblings. All MHC class I and II proteins are polymorphic to a greater or lesser extent, with the exception of the DR\u03b1 chain and its mouse homolog E\u03b1. These chains do not vary in sequence between different individuals and are said to be monomorphic. This might indicate a functional constraint that prevents variation in the DR\u03b1and E\u03b1 proteins, but no such special function has been found.

Investigation of large families with multigenerational FAD led to the discovery of two additional AD-causing genes, the presenilins.

All that can be stated with certainty is that, on average, the presence of the e4 allele accelerates the appearance of Alzheimer disease by about 5 years.

The consideration of lyonization must begin with Mary Lyon, who in 1962 proposed that in females, only one X chromosome is genetically active. X inactivation occurs early in fetal life, about 16 days after conception. Either the paternal or the maternal X chromosome is randomly inactivated in each cell of the developing embryo. Once inactivated, the same X chromosome remains inactive in all of the progeny of these cells.

This observation has implications for monosomic X chromosome disorders, or Turner syndrome, as discussed later. Extra Y chromosomes are readily tolerated because the only information known to be carried on the Y chromosome seems to relate to male differentiation.

This phenomenon explains why normal females do not have a double dose (compared with males) of phenotypic attributes encoded on the X chromosome. The Lyon hypothesis also explains why normal females are in reality mosaics, containing two cell populations: one with an active maternal X, the other with an active paternal X. The molecular basis of X inactivation involves a long non\u2013coding RNA that is encoded by the XIST gene. This non\u2013coding RNA is retained in the nucleus, where it \u201ccoats\u201d the X chromosome that it is transcribed from and silences the genes on that chromosome.

Similarly, hemizygous-deficient males (with a deficient copy of the G6PD gene on their single X chromosome) and homozygous-deficient females (with two deficient copies) express reduced activity phenotypes (Table 5\u20131).

G6PD enzyme activity phenotype estimations for heterozygous females therefore may be improved with complementary G6PD activity testing. G6PD enzyme deficiency affects over 400 million people worldwide, and the World Health Organization has categorized G6PD activity into five classes (Table 5\u20133). The majority of polymorphic G6PD-deficient genotypes are associated with class II for severe deficiency (< 10% enzyme activity) and class III for moderate deficiency (10\u201360% enzyme activity).

The G6PD gene is X-linked, and this has important implications. First, because males have only one G6PD gene (i.e., they are hemizy gous for this gene), they must be either normal or G6PD deficient. By contrast, females, who have two G6PD genes, can be either normal or deficient (homozygous) or intermediate (heterozygous). As a result of the phenomenon of X chromosome inactivation, heterozygous females are genetic mosaics, with a highly variable ratio of G6PDnormal to G6PD-deficient cells and an equally variable degree of clinical expression; some heterozygotes can be just as affected as hemizygous males.

Genetics Gem: GSD Ia is an autosomal-recessive disorder caused by >100 known mutations to the gene for glucose 6-phosphatase located on chromosome 17. It has an incidence of 1:100,000 and accounts for ~25% of all cases of GSD in the United States. It is one of the few genetic causes of hypoglycemia in newborns. GSD Ia is not routinely screened for in newborns. [Note: Deficiency of the translocase that moves glucose 6phosphate into the ER is the cause of GSD Ib.

In this situation, there is a 25% chance that the offspring will have a normal genotype, a 50% probability of a heterozygous state, and a 25% risk of homozygosity for the recessive alleles (Figs. 82-10, 82-13B). In the case of one unaffected heterozygous and one affected homozygous parent, the probability of disease increases to 50% for each child. In this instance, the pedigree analysis mimics an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance (pseudodominance). In contrast to autosomal dominant disorders, new mutations in recessive alleles are rarely manifest because they usually result in an asymptomatic carrier state. x-linkeD DisorDers Males have only one X chromosome; consequently, a daughter always inherits her father\u2019s X chromosome in addition to one of her mother\u2019s two X chromosomes.

By contrast, random inactivation of one X chromosome in heterozygous females (Chapter 7) creates two populations of red cells, one normal and the other G6PD-deficient. Most carrier females are unaffected except for those with a large proportion of deficient red cells (a chance situation known as unfavorable lyonization). In the case of the G6PD A\u2212 variant, it is mainly older red cells that are susceptible to lysis. Because the marrow compensates for the anemia by increasing its production of new red cells with adequate levels of G6PD, the hemolysis abates even if the drug exposure continues.

A definitive diagnosis of glycolytic disease is made by muscle biopsy and subsequent enzyme analysis or by genetic testing. Myophosphorylase deficiency, phosphofructokinase deficiency, and phosphoglycerate mutase deficiency are inherited as autosomal recessive disorders. Phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency is X-linked recessive. Mutations can be found in the respective genes encoding the abnormal proteins in each of these disorders.

For example, the vast majority of bacterial transposons are DNA-only types, with a few related to the nonretroviral retrotransposons also present. In yeasts, the main mobile elements are retroviral-like retrotransposons. In Drosophila, DNA-based, retroviral, and nonretroviral transposons are all found.

Most transposons are only modestly selective in choosing their target site, and they can therefore insert themselves into many different locations in a genome. In particular, there is no general requirement for sequence similarity between the ends of the element and the target sequence. Most transposons move only rarely. In bacteria, where it is possible to measure the frequency accurately, transposons typically move once every 105 cell divisions. More frequent movement would probably destroy the host cell\u2019s genome.

Some Viruses Use a Transposition Mechanism to Move Themselves Into Host-Cell Chromosomes Certain viruses are considered mobile genetic elements because they use transposition mechanisms to integrate their genomes into that of their host cell. However, unlike transposons, these viruses encode proteins that package their genetic information into virus particles that can infect other cells. Many of the viruses that insert themselves into a host chromosome do so by employing one of the first two mechanisms listed in Table 5\u20134; namely, by behaving like DNA-only transposons or like retroviral-like retrotransposons. Indeed, much of our knowledge of these mechanisms has come from studies of particular viruses", "DNA also contains many genes specifying proteins required in chloroplasts. In both cases, the DNA sequences of these nuclear genes show clear evidence of their origin from the bacterial ancestor of the respective organelle. Natural selection has evidently favored mitochondria with small genomes. By contrast, the nuclear genomes of most eukaryotes seem to have been free to enlarge. Perhaps the eukaryotic way of life has made large size an advantage: predators typically need to be bigger than their prey, and cell size generally increases in proportion to genome size. Whatever the reason, aided by a massive accumulation of DNA segments derived from parasitic transposable elements (discussed in Chapter 5), the genomes of most eukaryotes have become orders of magnitude larger than those of bacteria and archaea (Figure 1\u201332).", "order on each chromosome is almost identical.

In this case, the syndromes are not caused by deletions on chromosome 15 but by the inheritance of either two maternal chromosomes (Prader-Willi syndrome) or two paternal chromosomes (Angelman\u2019s syndrome).

This phenomenon is explained by genomic imprinting. Imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon, a nonheritablechange in the DNA that causes an alteration in gene expressionbased on parental origin of the gene. PWS is caused by deficiency of the protein product of the gene SNRPN (small nuclearribonucleoprotein). Although present on both maternally andpaternally derived chromosome 15, SNRPN is expressed onlyin the paternally derived chromosome. Expression is blocked inthe maternal chromosome because the bases of the open readingframe are methylated; this physical change in the DNA preventsgene expression.

Deletion of this maternal gene on chromosome 15 gives rise to the Angelman syndrome. The neurologic manifestations of Angelman are principally because of a lack of UBE3A expression in specific regions of the brain. Molecular studies of cytogenetically normal patients with Prader-Willi syndrome have shown that in some cases, both of the structurally normal copies of chromosome 15 are derived from the mother. Inheritance of both chromosomes of a pair from one parent is called uniparental disomy. The net effect is the same (i.e., the patient does not have a functional set of genes from the [nonimprinted] paternal chromosome 15). Angelman syndrome, as might be expected, also can result from uniparental disomy of paternal chromosome 15. Site of deletion Site of", "change in the DNA preventsgene expression. PWS results whenever a paternal chromosome15 is missing, either through deletion or through UPD. AS results from a lack of expression of ubiquitin-protein ligase E3A (UBE3A), a second gene in the chromosome 15q11.2 region. UBE3A is normally expressed only in the maternally derived chromosome 15. Although present in paternal chromosome 15, UBE3A is methylated, and gene expression is blocked. Therefore, if either the critical region of maternal chromosome 15 is deleted, or paternal UPD occurs, the individual will manifest symptoms of AS.

Disorders caused by expansion of trinucleotide repeats include Fragile X syndrome, Huntington disease,", "in every cell of a female. Gene inactivation through genomic imprinting occurs on selected chromosomal regions of autosomes and leads to inheritable preferential expression of one of the parental alleles. It is of pathophysiologic importance in disorders where the transmission of disease is dependent on the sex of the transmitting parent and, thus, plays an important role in the expression of certain genetic disorders. Two classic examples are the Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman\u2019s syndrome (Chap. 83e). Prader-Willi syndrome is characterized by diminished fetal activity, obesity, hypotonia, mental retardation, short stature, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Deletions of the paternal copy of the Prader-Willi locus located on the short arm of chromosome 15 result in a contiguous gene syndrome involving missing paternal copies of the necdin and SNRPN genes, among others.", "a functional set of genes from the [nonimprinted] paternal chromosome 15).

As mentioned earlier and as illustrated by several examples, many diseases of infancy and childhood are of genetic origin. Others, although not genetic, either are unique to children or take distinctive forms in this patient population and thus merit the designation pediatric diseases. During each stage of development, infants and children are prey to a somewhat different group of diseases ( Table 7.5 ). Clearly, diseases of infancy (i.e., in the first year of life) pose the highest risk of death. During this phase,", "of a deletion (in the paternal chromosome), the patient develops Prader-Willi syndrome. Among the set of genes that are deleted in Prader-Willi syndrome, the most likely culprit is believed to be a gene cluster encoding multiple distinct small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), which are involved in messenger RNA processing. Conversely, a distinct gene, UBE3A, that also maps to the same region of chromosome 15 isimprinted on thepaternalchromosome. UBE3A encodes for a ubiquitin ligase, a family of enzymes that targets other cellular proteins for proteasomal degradation (Chapter 1) through the addition of ubiquitin moieties. Only the maternally derived allele of the gene normally is active. Deletion of this maternal gene on chromosome 15 gives rise to the Angelman syndrome. The neurologic manifestations of Angelman are principally because of a lack", "as well as related events such as modification of DNA-binding histone proteins, the sum total effect of which is to silence the gene. Imprinting occurs in ova or sperm and is then stably transmitted to all somatic cells derived from the zygote. Genomic imprinting is best illustrated by considering two uncommon genetic disorders, Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome. Mental retardation, short stature, hypotonia, obesity, small hands and feet, and hypogonadism characterize Prader-Willi syndrome. In 60% to 75% of cases, an interstitial deletion of band q12 in the long arm of chromosome 15\u2014del(15)(q11;q13)\u2014can be detected. In many patients without a detectable cytogenetic abnormality, FISH analysis shows smaller deletions within the same region. It is striking that in all cases, the deletion affects the paternally derived chromosome 15. In contrast", "small hands, feet, and external genitalia; and mild mental retardation. In more than 70 percent of cases, PraderWilli syndrome is caused by microdeletion or disruption for the paternal 15q 11.2-q 13. The remaining cases are due to maternal uniparental disomy or due to maternal gene imprinting with the paternal gene inactivated. In contrast, Angelman syndrome includes severe intellectual disability; normal stature and weight; absent speech; seizure disorder; ataxia and jerky arm movements; and paroxysms of inappropriate laughter. In approximately 70 percent of cases, Angelman syndrome is caused by microdeletion for the maternal 15q 11.2-q 13. In 2 percent, the syndrome is caused by paternal uniparental disomy, and another 2 to 3 percent is due to paternal gene imprinting with the maternal genes inactivated. here are other examples of", "altering the underlying nucleotide sequence. For example, methyl group addition may alter gene expression and thereby afect the phenotype without changing the genotype. Importantly, the efect may be reversed in a subsequent generation, because a female who inherits an imprinted gene from her father will pass it in her oocytes with a maternal-rather than paternal-imprint, and vice versa. Selected diseases that can involve imprinting are shown in Table 13-5. A useful example includes two very diferent dis eases that afect the same region of DNA. First, Prader-Willi syndrome is characterized by obesity and hyperphagia; short stature; small hands, feet, and external genitalia; and mild mental retardation.

MOLECULAR INFLUENCES The cause of obesity can be summarized in a deceptively simple application of the first law of thermodynamics: Obesity results when energy (caloric) intake exceeds energy expenditure. However, the mechanism underlying this imbalance involves a complex interaction of biochemical, neurologic, environmental, and psychologic factors. The basic neural and humoral pathways that regulate appetite, energy expenditure, and body weight involve systems that regulate short-term food intake (meal to meal), and signals for the long-term (day to day, week to week, year to year) regulation of body", "patterns; the difference lies in the way these patterns bring about differential expression of the imprinted gene. Why imprinting should exist at all is a mystery. In vertebrates, it is restricted to placental mammals, and many of the imprinted genes are involved in fetal development. One idea is that imprinting reflects a middle ground in the evolutionary struggle between males to produce larger offspring and females to limit offspring size. Whatever its purpose might be, imprinting provides startling evidence that features of DNA other than its sequence of nucleotides can be inherited. We have seen that DNA methylation and certain types of chromatin structure can be heritable, preserving patterns of gene expression across cell generations. Perhaps the most striking example of this effect occurs in mammals, in which", "important exception to classical genetic behavior, and several hundred mouse genes are thought to be affected in this way. however, the majority of mouse genes are not imprinted, and therefore the rules of Mendelian inheritance apply to most of the mouse genome. In the early embryo, genes subject to imprinting are marked by methylation according to whether they were derived from a sperm or an egg chromosome. In this way, DNA methylation is used as a mark to distinguish two copies of a gene that may be otherwise identical (Figure 7\u201348). Because imprinted genes are somehow protected from the wave of demethylation that takes place shortly after fertilization (see pp. 404\u2013405), this mark enables somatic cells to \u201cremember\u201d the parental origin of each of the two copies of", "later in pregnancy and, importantly, by the unpredictable development of superimposed preeclampsia. The latter carries increased risks for maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. To define chronic hypertension, the range of normal blood pressure must irst be established. This is not a simple task because, like all polygenically determined biological variants, blood pressure norms difer between populations. And, within these norms, wide variations are found between individuals. Moreover, numerous epigenetic factors inluence presentation. For example, not only do blood pressures vary between races and genders, but pressures-especially systolic-rise directly with increasing age and weight.

Families with relatives affected with genetic disorders may have questions about how a disorder is inherited. The inheritance pattern and the risk of having an affected child can be discussed with a geneticist. In some cultures, it is common for relatives to mate.

If a single copy of a gene bearing a mutation is sufficient to cause disease and that gene is not on one of the sex chromosomes, that condition is inherited in an AD fashion (Table 47-1). In AD disorders, an affected parent has a 50% chance of passing the mutated gene to each child (Fig. 47-2; Table 47-2). Possessing one working gene and one nonworking gene is termed heterozygous.

Because of these variations, it is sometimes challenging to determine the pattern of inheritance. It should be recognized, however, that some individuals acquire a mutated gene from an unaffected parent.

One attractive theory to explain such an end result imagines that different, mildly deleterious mutations occur quickly in both copies of a duplicated gene set. For example, one copy might lose expression in a particular tissue as a result of a regulatory mutation, while the other copy loses expression in a second tissue. Following such an occurrence, both gene copies would be required to provide the full range of functions that were once supplied by a single gene; hence, both copies would now be protected from loss through inactivating mutations.

Mutation detection Southern blotting can detect DNA mutations such as large insertions or deletions, trinucleotide repeat expansions, and rearrangements of nucleotides. It can also detect point mutations (replacement of one nucleotide by another; see p. 449) that cause the loss or gain of restriction sites. Such mutations cause the pattern of bands to differ from those seen with a normal gene. Longer fragments are generated if a restriction site is lost. For example, in Figure 34.13, person 2 lacks a restriction site present in person 1. Alternatively, the point mutation may create a new cleavage site with the production of shorter fragments.

Several genetic mechanisms contribute to the generation of new alleles. Some new alleles arise by point mutations and others by gene conversion, a process in which a sequence in one gene is replaced, in part, by sequences from a different gene (Fig. 6.20). The effects of selective pressure in favor of polymorphism can be seen clearly in the pattern of point mutations in the MHC genes. Point mutations can be classified as replacement substitutions, which change an amino acid, or silent substitutions, which simply change the codon but leave the amino acid the same. Replacement substitutions occur within the MHC at a higher frequency relative to silent substitutions than would be expected, providing evidence that polymorphism has been actively selected for in the evolution", "gene can in theory be accomplished through the introduction of a stop codon anywhere in the coding sequence, whereas activations require precise substitutions at residues that can somehow lead to an increase in the activity of the encoded protein. Importantly, the specificity of oncogene mutations provides diagnostic opportunities, as tests that identify mutations at defined positions are easier to design than tests aimed at detecting random changes in a gene. The second mechanism for activation of oncogenes is DNA sequence amplification, leading to overexpression of the gene product. This increase in DNA copy number may cause cytologically recognizable chromosome alterations referred to as homogeneous staining regions (HSRs) if integrated within chromosomes, or double minutes (dmins) if extrachromosomal.

In clinical trials it is important for the investigator to address the beta error, even in the design stage of the study.

While neither of the first two assumptions is a good description of human population history, study of this idealized case reveals the general principles in a clear and simple way. When a new neutral mutation occurs in a population of constant size N that is undergoing random mating, the probability that it will ultimately become fixed is approximately 1/(2N). This is because there are 2N copies of the gene in the diploid population, and each of them has an equal chance of becoming the predominant version in the long run. For those mutations that do become fixed, the mathematics shows that the average time to fixation is approximately 4N generations. Detailed analyses of", "we saw earlier, they account for most of the DNA sequence differences between apes and humans. The spread of neutral mutations is not as rapid as the spread of the rare strongly advantageous mutations. It depends on a random variation in the number of mutation-bearing progeny produced by each mutation-bearing individual, causing changes in the relative frequency of the mutant allele in the population. Through a sort of \u201crandom walk\u201d process, the mutant allele may eventually become extinct, or it may become commonplace.

With a population that has reached this size, the probability that a new, selectively neutral mutation would become fixed is small (1/20,000), while the average time to fixation would be on the order of 800,000 years (assuming a 20-year generation time).

Conversely, the rare mutations that confer a major reproductive advantage on individuals who inherit them can spread rapidly in the population.

In the case of sickle cell anemia (Fig. 34.17), the point mutation that gives rise to the disease (see p. 35) is actually one and the same mutation that gives rise to the polymorphism. However, direct detection by RFLP of diseases that result from point mutations is limited to only a few genetic diseases. a. Early diagnostic efforts: In the past, prenatal diagnosis of sickle cell anemia involved the determination of the amount and kinds of Hb synthesized in the nucleated red cells obtained from fetal blood. However, the invasive procedures to obtain fetal blood have a high mortality rate (~5%),", "with the added complication that the HbH molecule behaves like moderately unstable hemoglobin. Patients with HbH disease should undergo splenectomy if excessive anemia or a transfusion requirement develops. Oxidative drugs should be avoided. Iron overload leading to death can occur in more severely affected patients. Antenatal diagnosis of thalassemia syndromes is now widely available. DNA diagnosis is based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of fetal DNA, obtained by amniocentesis or chorionic villus biopsy followed by hybridization to allele-specific oligonucleotide probes or direct DNA sequencing. Thalassemic structural variants are characterized by both defective synthesis and abnormal structure.

In the case of one unaffected heterozygous and one affected homozygous parent, the probability of disease increases to 50% for each child. In this instance, the pedigree analysis mimics an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance (pseudodominance). In contrast to autosomal dominant disorders, new mutations in recessive alleles are rarely manifest because they usually result in an asymptomatic carrier state. x-linkeD DisorDers Males have only one X chromosome; consequently, a daughter always inherits her father\u2019s X chromosome in addition to one of her mother\u2019s two X chromosomes.

Because of these variations, it is sometimes challenging to determine the pattern of inheritance. It should be recognized, however, that some individuals acquire a mutated gene from an unaffected parent. De novo germline mutations occur more frequently during later cell divisions in gametogenesis, which explains why siblings are rarely affected. As noted before, new germline mutations occur more frequently in fathers of advanced age. For example, the average age of fathers with new germline", "result of recessive and multifactorial disorders (Baird, 1982; Freire-Maia, 1984). Most X-linked diseases are recessive. Common examples include color blindness, hemophilia A and B, and Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy. Males with an X-linked recessive gene are usually afected by the disease it causes, because they lack a second X chromosome to express the normal dominant gene. A male with an X-linked disease cannot have afected sons because they cannot receive his X chromosome. When a woman carries a gene causing an X-linked recessive condition, each of her sons has a 50-percent risk of being afected, and each daughter has a 50-percent chance of being a carrier. Women with an X-linked recessive gene are generally unaffected by the disease it causes. In some cases, however, the random inactivation", "and each daughter has a 50-percent chance of being a carrier. Women with an X-linked recessive gene are generally unaffected by the disease it causes. In some cases, however, the random inactivation of one X chromosome in each cell-termed lyonization-is skewed, and female carriers may have features of the condition. For example, approximately 10 percent of female carriers of hemophilia A will have factor VIII levels less than 30 percent of normal, and a similar proportion of female hemophilia B carriers have factor IX levels less than 30 percent. Levels below these thresholds confer a greater risk for abnormal bleeding when afected women give birth (Plug, 2006). Indeed, even with higher levels, carriers are reported to be at increased risk for bleeding complications (Olsson, 2014). Similarly, female carriers", "percent; or severe-less than 1 percent (Arruda, 2015). Hemophilia A is an X-linked recessively transmitted disorder characterized by a marked deiciency of factor VIII. It is rare among women compared with men, in whom the heterozygous state is responsible for the disease. Heterozygous women have diminished factor VIII levels, but almost invariably, the homozygous state is requisite for hemophilia A. In a few instances, it appears in women spontaneously from a newly mutated gene. Pregnancy-associated acquired hemophilia A from antibodies may result in severe bleeding-related morbidity (Tengborn, 2012).

Cause and pathogenesis The hereditary nature of NF has been appreciated for a century. More recently, it has been established that NF comprises two distinct disorders, the genes for", "of constant population size and random mating, as well as selective neutrality for the mutations. While neither of the first two assumptions is a good description of human population history, study of this idealized case reveals the general principles in a clear and simple way. When a new neutral mutation occurs in a population of constant size N that is undergoing random mating, the probability that it will ultimately become fixed is approximately 1/(2N). This is because there are 2N copies of the gene in the diploid population, and each of them has an equal chance of becoming the predominant version in the long run. For those mutations that do become fixed, the mathematics shows that the average time to fixation is approximately 4N generations.

Sphingolipidoses In a normal individual, synthesis and degradation of glycosphingolipids are balanced, so that the amount of these compounds present in membranes is constant. If a specific lysosomal acid hydrolase required for degradation is partially or totally missing, a sphingolipid accumulates. Lysosomal lipid storage diseases caused by these deficiencies are called sphingolipidoses.

Nonsense mutation: The codon containing the changed base may become a termination codon.

Thus, for example, a mutation in a nucleotide sequence critical for splicing of a particular intron does not necessarily prevent splicing of that intron altogether. Instead, the mutation typically creates a new pattern of splicing (Figure 6\u201333). Most commonly, an exon is simply skipped (Figure 6\u201333B). In other cases, the mutation causes a cryptic splice junction to be efficiently used (Figure 6\u201333C).

If the nucleotide listed in the first column is present at the third, or wobble, position of the codon, it can base-pair with any of the nucleotides listed in the second column. Thus, for example, when inosine (I) is present in the wobble position of the tRNA anticodon, the tRNA can recognize any one of three different codons in bacteria and either of two codons in eukaryotes.

Each cycle doubles the amount of DNA synthesized in the previous cycle, so that within a few cycles, the predominant DNA is identical to the sequence bracketed by and including the two primers in the original template.

Although maternal serum screening was initially used to detect high levels of AFP associated with neural tube defects (NTDs) and the disruption of fetal integument such as omphalocele or gastroschisis, low levels of AFP were found to be associated with fetal aneuploidy.

The terms level I and level II sonography were coined in this context. In the California MSAFP Screening Program of the 1980s and early 1990s, women received serum screening prior to sonography, and those with an elevated MSAFP level would undergo level I sonography to identiy an incorrect gestational age, mulrifetal gestation, or fetal demise (Filly, 1993).

The wounded plant cells at the edge of the disc release substances that attract the bacteria, which inject their DNA into the plant cells. Only those plant cells that take up the appropriate DNA and express the selectable marker gene survive and proliferate and form a callus. The manipulation of growth factors supplied to the callus induces it to form shoots, which subsequently root and grow into adult plants carrying the engineered gene.

Restriction endonucleases cleave dsDNA into fragments of different sizes depending upon the size of the sequence recognized. For example, an enzyme that recognizes a specific 4-bp sequence produces many cuts in the DNA molecule, one every 44 bp. In contrast, an enzyme requiring a unique sequence of 6 bp produces fewer cuts (one every 46 bp) and, therefore, longer pieces. Hundreds of these enzymes, each having different cleavage specificities (varying in both nucleotide sequences and length of recognition sites), are commercially available. III. DNA CLONING Introduction of a foreign DNA", "gene in a mammalian genome would still be only one among a hundred thousand or more DNA fragments, indistinguishable in their average size. How could such a gene be separated from all the others? Because all DNA molecules consist of an approximately equal mixture of the same four nucleotides, they cannot be readily separated, as proteins can, on the basis of their different charges and biochemical properties. The solution to this problem began to emerge with the discovery of restriction nucleases. These enzymes, which are purified from bacteria, cut the DNA double helix at specific sites defined by the local nucleotide sequence, thereby cleaving a long, double-stranded DNA molecule into fragments of strictly defined sizes. Like many of the tools of recombinant DNA technology, restriction nucleases were discovered", "enzyme used, the chances are good that the gene of interest contains more than one restriction site recognized by that enzyme. If this is the case, and if the digestion is allowed to go to completion, the gene of interest is fragmented (that is, it is not contained in any one clone in the library). To avoid this usually undesirable result, a partial digestion is performed in which either the amount or the time of action of the enzyme is limited. This results in cleavage occurring at only a fraction of the restriction sites on any one DNA molecule, thus producing fragments of ~20 kb. Enzymes that cut very frequently (that is, those that recognize 4-bp sequences) are generally used for this purpose so that the result is", "are so useful in the laboratory is that each enzyme will always cut a particular DNA molecule at the same sites. Thus for a given sample of DNA (which contains many identical molecules), a particular restriction nuclease will reliably generate the same set of DNA fragments. The size of the resulting fragments depends on the length of the target sequences of the restriction nucleases. As shown in Figure 8\u201324, the enzyme HaeIII cuts at a sequence of four nucleotide pairs; a sequence this long would be expected to occur purely by chance approximately once every 256 nucleotide pairs (1 in 44). In comparison, a restriction nuclease with a target sequence that is eight nucleotides long would be expected to cleave DNA on average once every 65,536 nucleotide pairs", "genomic DNA is the immense size of the molecules involved. The discovery of a special group of bacterial enzymes, called restriction endonucleases (restriction enzymes), which cleave double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) into smaller, more manageable fragments, opened the way for DNA analysis. Because each enzyme cleaves dsDNA at a specific nucleotide sequence (restriction site), restriction enzymes are used experimentally to obtain precisely defined DNA segments called restriction fragments. A. Specificity Restriction endonucleases recognize short stretches of dsDNA (4\u20138 bp) that contain specific nucleotide sequences. These sequences, which differ for each restriction enzyme, are palindromes, that is, they exhibit twofold rotational symmetry (Fig. 34.2). This means that, within a short region of the dsDNA, the nucleotide sequence on the two strands is identical if each is read in the 5\u2032\u21923\u2032 direction.", "nucleotide pairs (1 in 44). In comparison, a restriction nuclease with a target sequence that is eight nucleotides long would be expected to cleave DNA on average once every 65,536 nucleotide pairs (1 in 48). This difference in sequence selectivity makes it possible to cleave a long DNA molecule into the fragment sizes that are most suitable for a given application. Gel Electrophoresis Separates DNA Molecules of Different Sizes The same types of gel-electrophoresis methods that have proved so useful in the analysis of proteins (see Figure 8\u201313) can be applied to DNA molecules. The procedure is actually simpler than for proteins: because each nucleotide in a nucleic acid molecule already carries a single negative charge (on the phosphate group), there is no need to add the negatively", "molecules of identical length (Figure 8\u201325A and B). To separate DNA molecules longer than 500 nucleotide pairs, the gel is made of a diluted solution of agarose (a polysaccharide isolated from seaweed). For DNA fragments less than 500 nucleotides long, specially designed polyacrylamide gels allow the separation of molecules that differ in length by as little as a single nucleotide (see Figure 8\u201325C). Figure 8\u201324 Restriction nucleases cleave DNA at specific nucleotide sequences. Like the sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins we encountered in Chapter 7 (see Figure 7\u20138), restriction enzymes often work as dimers, and the DNA sequence they recognize and cleave is often symmetrical around a central point. Here, both strands of the DNA double helix are cut at specific points within the target sequence (orange). Some enzymes, such", "for amplification of specific nucleotide sequences, and 3) the ability to synthesize specific probes, which has allowed the identification and manipulation of nucleotide sequences of interest. These and other experimental approaches have permitted the identification of both normal and mutant nucleotide sequences in DNA. This knowledge has led to the development of methods for the diagnosis of genetic diseases and some successes in the treatment of patients by gene therapy. [Note: The genomes of several viruses, prokaryotes, and nonhuman eukaryotes have also been sequenced.] II. RESTRICTION ENDONUCLEASES One of the major obstacles to molecular analysis of genomic DNA is the immense size of the molecules involved. The discovery of a special group of bacterial enzymes, called restriction endonucleases (restriction enzymes), which cleave double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) into smaller, more", "dsDNA obtained by digestion of the total DNA of the organism with a restriction endonuclease and subsequent ligation to an appropriate vector. It ideally contains a copy of every DNA nucleotide sequence in the genome. In contrast, complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries contain only those DNA sequences that are complementary to processed messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules present in a cell and differ according to cell type and environmental conditions. Because cDNA has no introns, it can be cloned into an expression vector for the synthesis of human proteins by bacteria or eukaryotes. Cloned, then purified, fragments of DNA can be sequenced, for example, using the Sanger dideoxy chain termination method. A probe is a small piece of RNA or single-stranded DNA (usually labeled with a radioisotope, such as 32P,", "105). Even if the copies retained in the final product constituted as little as 5% of the total genome (for example, 10 nucleotides per 200-nucleotide DNA fragment), the resulting increase in the overall mutation rate would be enormous. It therefore seems likely that the use of RNA rather than DNA for priming brings a powerful advantage to the cell: the ribonucleotides in the primer automatically mark these sequences as \u201csuspect copy\u201d to be efficiently removed and replaced.

Cloning DNA by using bacteria revolutionized the study of genomes and is still in wide use today. However, there is an even simpler way to clone DNA, one that can be carried out entirely in vitro. We discuss this approach, called the polymerase chain reaction, below. However, first we need to review a fundamental, far-reaching property of DNA and RNA called hybridization.

The nucleotide sequence of each insert was determined separately and the sequence of the entire genome was stitched together from the pieces. The most important advantage of cDNA clones, over genomic clones, is that they contain the uninterrupted coding sequence of a gene. When the aim of the cloning, for example, is to produce the protein in large quantities by expressing the cloned gene in a bacterial or yeast cell, it is more preferable to start with cDNA.

Depending on the characteristics of the cloning vector, the plasmid is introduced into bacterial, yeast, insect, or mammalian cells, where the inserted gene is efficiently transcribed and translated into protein. If the gene to be overexpressed has no introns (typical for genes from bacteria, archaea, and simple eukaryotes), it can simply be cloned from genomic DNA by PCR. For cloned animal and plant genes, it is often more convenient to obtain the gene as cDNA, either from a cDNA library (see Figure", "simply be cloned from genomic DNA by PCR. For cloned animal and plant genes, it is often more convenient to obtain the gene as cDNA, either from a cDNA library (see Figure 8\u201332) or cloned directly by PCR from RNA isolated from the organism (see Figure 8\u201337).

B. Advantages The major advantages of PCR over biologic cloning as a mechanism for amplifying a specific DNA sequence are sensitivity and speed. DNA sequences present in only trace amounts can be amplified to become the predominant sequence. PCR is so sensitive that DNA sequences present in an individual cell can be amplified and studied. Isolating and amplifying a specific DNA sequence by PCR is faster and less technically difficult than traditional cloning methods using recombinant DNA techniques. C.

In the first step (A), an altered version of the gene is introduced into cultured ES (embryonic stem) cells. These cells are described in detail in Chapter 22. Only a few ES cells will have their corresponding normal genes replaced by the altered gene through a homologous recombination event. These cells can be identified by PCR and cultured to produce many descendants, each of which carries an altered gene in place of one of its two normal corresponding genes. In the next step of the procedure (B), these altered ES cells are injected into a very early mouse embryo; the cells are incorporated into the growing embryo, and a mouse produced by such", "the biologic cloning method. PCR permits the synthesis of millions of copies of a specific nucleotide sequence in a few hours. It can amplify the sequence, even when the targeted sequence makes up less than one part in a million of the total initial sample. The method can be used to amplify DNA sequences from any source. Applications of the PCR technique include 1) efficient comparison of a normal gene with a mutant form of the gene, 2) forensic analysis of DNA samples, 3) detection of low-abundance nucleic acid sequences, and 4) prenatal diagnosis and carrier detection (for example, of cystic fibrosis).

DNA libraries A DNA library is a collection of cloned restriction fragments of the DNA of an organism. Two kinds of libraries are commonly used: genomic libraries and complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries. Genomic libraries ideally contain a copy of every DNA nucleotide sequence in the genome.

This represents a very basic technique that is widely used in almost all areas of biomedical research. DNA vectors often are called plasmids, which are extrachromosomal molecules of DNA that vary in size and can replicate and be transmitted from bacterial cell to cell. Plasmids can be propagated either in the cytoplasm or after insertion, as part of the bacterial chromosome in Escherichia coli. The process of molecular cloning involves several steps of manipulation of DNA.

Prokaryotic organisms normally contain small, circular, extrachromosomal DNA molecules called plasmids that can serve as vectors.

A DNA library is a collection of cloned restriction fragments of the DNA of an organism.

However, the interaction between the polymerase and DNA is far more complex in eukaryotes than in prokaryotes. Because the majority of studies have been focused on the regulation and functions of proteins, this chapter primarily focuses on how protein-encoding mRNA is made by RNA polymerase II.Translation. DNA directs the synthesis of RNA; RNA in turn directs the synthesis of proteins. Proteins are variable-length polypeptide polymers composed of various combinations of 20 different amino acids and are the working molecules of the cell. The process of decoding information on mRNA to synthesize proteins is called translation (see Fig. 15-1). Translation takes place", "on a different chromosome. Although there is much we do not understand about this mechanism, it indicates the extreme versatility of transcriptional regulation strategies. Transcription regulators switch the transcription of individual genes on and off in cells. In prokaryotes, these proteins typically bind to specific DNA sequences close to the RNA polymerase start site and, depending on the nature of the regulatory protein and the precise location of its binding site relative to the start site, either activate or repress transcription of the gene. The flexibility of the DNA helix, however, also allows proteins bound at distant sites to affect the RNA polymerase at the promoter by the looping out of the intervening DNA. The regulation of higher eukaryotic genes is much more complex, commensurate with a larger", "about 50 nucleotides of rnA. the activities shown in figure 7\u201319 can affect each of these four steps. by a double amount and speed up the reaction 10,000-fold. Even if A and B work simply by attracting the same protein, the affinity of that protein for the reaction site increases multiplicatively. Thus, transcription activators often exhibit transcriptional synergy, where several DNA-bound activator proteins working together produce a transcription rate that is much higher than the sum of their transcription rates working alone (Figure 7\u201322). An important point is that a transcription activator protein must be bound to DNA to influence transcription of its target gene. And the rate of transcription of a gene ultimately depends upon the spectrum of regulatory proteins bound upstream and downstream of its transcription", "moving among them in an orderly fashion according to the needs of the cell. Before the synthesis of a particular protein can begin, the corresponding mRNA molecule must be produced by transcription. Bacteria contain a single type of RNA polymerase (the enzyme that carries out the transcription of DNA into RNA). An mRNA molecule is produced after this enzyme initiates transcription at a promoter, synthesizes the RNA by chain elongation, stops transcription at a terminator, and releases both the DNA template and the completed mRNA molecule. In eukaryotic cells, the process of transcription is much more complex, and there are three RNA polymerases\u2014polymerase I, II, and III\u2014that are related evolutionarily to one another and to the bacterial polymerase. RNA polymerase II synthesizes eukaryotic mRNA. This enzyme requires a", "of DnA signify that the length of DnA between the cis-regulatory sequences and the start of transcription RNA polymerase II, there are thousands of different transcription regulators devoted to turning individual genes on and off. In eukaryotes, operons\u2014sets of genes transcribed as a unit\u2014are rare, and, instead, each gene is regulated individually. Not surprisingly, the regulation of each gene is different in detail from that of every other gene, and it is difficult to formulate simple rules for gene regulation that apply in every case. We can, however, make some generalizations about how transcription regulators, once bound to gene control regions on DNA, set in motion the series of events that lead to gene activation or repression. In bacteria, we saw that proteins such as the tryptophan repressor,", "several steps.and tRNA. Transcription often is coupled with translation in such a way that an mRNA molecule is completely accessible to ribosomes, and bacterial protein synthesis begins on an mRNA molecule even while it is still being synthesized. Therefore, a discussion of gene regulation with a look at the simpler prokary-otic system precedes that of the more complex transcription and posttranscriptional regulation of eukaryotic genes.Transcription in Bacteria Initiation of transcription in pro-karyotes begins with the recognition of DNA sequences by RNA polymerase. First, the bacterial RNA polymerase cata-lyzes RNA synthesis through loose binding to any region in the double-stranded DNA and then through specific binding to the promoter region with the assistance of accessory pro-teins called \u03c3 factors (sigma factors). A promoter region is the DNA region upstream", "genes, as we saw in Chapter 6. This polymerase requires five general transcription factors (27 subunits in toto; see Table 6\u20133, p. 311), in contrast to bacterial RNA polymerase, which needs only a single general transcription factor (the \u03c3 subunit). As we have seen, the stepwise assembly of the general transcription factors at a eukaryotic promoter provides, in principle, multiple steps at which the cell can speed up or slow down the rate of transcription initiation in response to transcription regulators. Because the many cis-regulatory sequences that control the expression of a typical gene are often spread over long stretches of DNA, we use the term gene control region to describe the whole expanse of DNA involved in regulating and initiating transcription of a eukaryotic gene. This includes", "this generalization\u2014 cis-regulatory sequences can be located hundreds and even thousands of nucleotide pairs from the bacterial genes they control (Figure 7\u201316). In these cases, the intervening DNA is looped out, allowing a protein bound at a distant site along the DNA to contact RNA polymerase. Here, the DNA acts as a tether, enormously increasing the probability that the proteins will collide, compared with the situation where one protein is bound to DNA and the other is free in solution. We will see shortly that, although it is the exception in bacteria, DNA looping occurs in the regulation of nearly every eukaryotic gene. A possible explanation for this difference is based on evolutionary considerations. It has been proposed that the compact, simple genetic switches found in bacteria evolved", "of the most common ways of regulating the levels of its protein product is to control the step that initiates translation. Even though the details of translation initiation differ between eukaryotes and bacteria (as we saw in Chapter 6), they each use some of the same basic regulatory strategies. In bacterial mRNAs, a conserved stretch of nucleotides, the Shine\u2013Dalgarno sequence, is always found a few nucleotides upstream of the initiating AUG codon. In bacteria, translational control mechanisms are carried out by proteins or by RNA molecules, and they generally involve either exposing or blocking the Shine\u2013 Dalgarno sequence (Figure 7\u201366). Eukaryotic mRNAs do not contain such a sequence. Instead, as discussed in Chapter 6, the selection of an AUG codon as a translation start site is largely determined", "bacterial genes. It is also common in bac-teria that one promoter serves to transcribe a series of clustered genes, called an operon. A single transcribed mRNA contains a series of coding regions, each of which is later independently translated. In this way, the protein products are synthesized in a coordinated manner. Most of the time, these proteins are involved in the same metabolic pathway, thus demonstrating that the control by one operon is an efficient system. After ini-tiation of transcription, the polymerase moves along the DNA to elongate the chain of RNA, although at a certain point, it will stop.

Its gene product, the repressor protein, is always made and is active unless the inducer is present.] 3. When both glucose and lactose are available: In this case, the lac operon is uninduced, and transcription is negligible, even if lactose is present at a high concentration. Adenylyl cyclase is inhibited in the presence of glucose (a process known as catabolite repression) so no cAMP\u2013CAP complex forms, and the CAP site remains empty. Therefore, the RNA pol is unable to effectively initiate transcription, even though the repressor is not bound to the O site. Consequently, the", "cyclic AMp (red triangle) is produced by the cell, and CAp binds to DnA. a switch that carries out a logic operation in a computer. When lactose is present AND glucose is absent, the cell executes the appropriate program\u2014in this case, transcription of the genes that permit the uptake and utilization of lactose. All transcription regulators, whether they are repressors or activators, must be bound to DNA to exert their effects. In this way, each regulatory protein acts selectively, controlling only those genes that bear a cis-regulatory sequence recognized by it. The logic of the Lac operon first attracted the attention of biologists more than 50 years ago. The way it works was uncovered by a combination of genetics and biochemistry, providing some of the first insights into", "the movement of lactose into the cell; and the lacA gene codes for thiogalactoside transacetylase, which acetylates lactose. [Note: The physiologic function of this acetylation is unknown.] All of these proteins are maximally produced only when lactose is available to the cell and glucose is not. [Note: Bacteria use glucose, if available, as a fuel in preference to any other sugar.] The regulatory portion of the operon is upstream of the three structural genes and consists of the promoter region where RNA pol binds and two additional sites, the operator (O) and the catabolite activator protein (CAP) sites, where regulatory proteins bind. The lacZ, lacY, and lacA genes are maximally expressed only when the O site is empty and the CAP site is bound by a complex of", "production of enzymes that allow the bacterium to digest other sugars. An Activator and a repressor Control the Lac Operon In many instances, the activity of a single promoter is controlled by several different transcription regulators. The Lac operon in E. coli, for example, is controlled by both the Lac repressor and the CAP activator that we just discussed. The Lac operon encodes proteins required to import and digest the disaccharide lactose. In the absence of glucose, the bacterium makes cAMP, which activates CAP to switch on genes that allow the cell to utilize alternative sources of carbon\u2014 including lactose. It would be wasteful, however, for CAP to induce expression of the Lac operon if lactose itself were not present. Thus the Lac repressor shuts off the operon", "(groups of genes sequentially arranged on the chromosome along with the regulatory elements that determine their transcription). The lac operon contains the Z, Y, and A structural genes, the protein products of which are needed for the catabolism of lactose. It is subject to negative and positive regulation. When glucose is available, the operon is repressed by the binding of the repressor protein (the product of the lacI gene) to the operator, thus preventing transcription. When only lactose is present, the operon is induced by an isomer of lactose (allolactose) that binds the repressor protein, preventing it from binding to the operator. In addition, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) binds the catabolite activator protein (CAP), and the complex binds the DNA at the CAP site. This increases promoter efficiency", "for cells to use the sugar lactose as an energy source can be determined by growing the cells in the presence of a different sugar, such as glucose, and testing them subsequently to see how many have lost the ability to survive on a lactose diet. The fraction of damaged genes underestimates the actual mutation rate because many mutations are silent (for example, those that change a codon but not the amino acid it specifies, or those that change an amino acid without affecting the activity of the protein coded for by the gene). After correcting for these silent mutations, one finds that a single gene that encodes an average-sized protein (~103 coding nucleotide pairs) accumulates a mutation (not necessarily one that would inactivate the protein) approximately once", "an inducer that binds to the repressor protein, changing its conformation so that it can no longer bind to the O site. In the absence of glucose, adenylyl cyclase is active, and cAMP is made and binds to the CAP. The cAMP\u2013CAP transacting complex binds to the CAP site, causing RNA pol to initiate transcription with high efficiency at the promoter site (see Fig. 33.4B). This is an example of positive regulation. The transcript is a single polycistronic mRNA molecule that contains three sets of start and stop codons. Translation of the mRNA produces the three proteins that allow lactose to be used for energy production by the cell.

Arrangements of this type are common in the cell. In E. coli, for example, galactose metabolic genes are positively regulated by the catabolite activator protein (CAP), which is activated at high levels of cAMP. The same genes are repressed by the GalS repressor protein, which is encoded by a gene whose transcription is likewise activated by CAP. Thus, an increase in input (cAMP) activates A (CAP), and transcription of the galactose genes begins.

Like their mitotic counterparts, duplicated meiotic prophase chromosomes first appear as long threadlike structures, in which the sister chromatids are so tightly glued together that they appear as one. It is during early prophase I that the homologs begin to associate along their length in a process called pairing, which, in some organisms at least, begins with interactions between complementary DNA sequences (called pairing sites) in the two homologs. As prophase progresses, the homologs become more closely juxtaposed, forming a four-chromatid structure called a bivalent (Figure 17\u201354A). In most species, homolog pairs are then locked together by homologous recombination: DNA double-strand breaks are formed at several locations in each sister chromatid, resulting in large numbers of DNA recombination events between the homologs (as described in Chapter 5).", "requirement ensures that homologous recombination occurs only between identical or very similar DNA sequences. DNA SYNTHESIS FILLS GAP, CREATING AN EXTRA COPY OF THE RED ALLELE OF When used as a repair mechanism, homologous recombination occurs between a damaged DNA molecule and its recently duplicated sister molecule, with the undamaged duplex acting as a template to repair the damaged copy flawlessly. In meiosis, homologous recombination is initiated by deliberate, carefully regulated double-strand breaks and occurs preferentially between the homologous chromosomes rather than the newly replicated sister chromatids. The outcome can be either two chromosomes that have crossed over (that is, chromosomes in which the DNA on either side of the site of DNA pairing originates from two different homo-logs) or two non-crossover chromosomes. In the latter case, the", "and regulation of meiosis, with an emphasis on how they compare with those of mitosis. meiosis Includes Two Rounds of Chromosome segregation Meiosis reduces the chromosome number by half using many of the same molecular machines and control systems that operate in mitosis. As in the mitotic cell cycle, the cell begins the meiotic program by duplicating its chromosomes in meiotic S phase, resulting in pairs of sister chromatids that are tightly linked along their entire lengths by cohesin complexes. Unlike mitosis, however, two successive rounds of chromosome segregation then occur (Figure 17\u201353). The first of these divisions (meiosis I) solves the problem, unique to meiosis, of segregating the homologs. The duplicated paternal and maternal homologs pair up alongside each other and become physically linked by the process", "chromosome splits into two single-stranded chromosomes that are then distributed to each haploid daughter cell. Phases in the process of meiosis are similar to the phases of mitosis. The prophase of meiosis I is an extended phase in which pairing of homologous chromosomes, synapsis (close association of homologous chromosomes), and recombination of genetic material on homologous chromosomes is observed. Prophase I is subdivided into the following five stages (see Fig. 3.12). \u0081 Leptotene. This stage is characterized by the condensation of chromatin and by the appearance of chromosomes. Sister chromatids also condense and become connected with each other by meiosisspecifc cohesion complexes (Rec8p). At this phase, pairing of homologous chromosomes of maternal and paternal origin is initiated. Homologous pairing can be described as a process in which chromosomes", "and in anaphase I are separated and distributed to each daughter cell. This results in reduction of both the chromosome number (1n) and the DNA to the (2d) amount. No DNA replication precedes meiosis II. The division during meiosis II is always equatorial because the number of chromosomes does not change. It remains at (1n), although the amount of DNA represented by the number of chromatids is reduced to (1d). During metaphase II, each chromosome aligns along the equator of the mitotic spindle, and at anaphase II sister chromatids are separated from each other. Thus, each chromosome splits into two single-stranded chromosomes that are then distributed to each haploid daughter cell. Phases in the process of meiosis are similar to the phases of mitosis. The prophase of meiosis", "of each pair are randomly aligned on one side or the other of the metaphase plate, thus contributing to genetic diversity. At the completion of meiosis I, the cytoplasm divides. Each resulting daughter cell (a secondary spermatocyte or oocyte) is haploid in chromosome number (1n) and contains one member of each homologous chromosome pair. The cell is still diploid in DNA content (2d). After meiosis I, the cells quickly enter meiosis II without passing through an S phase. Meiosis II is an equatorial division and resembles mitosis. During this phase, the proteinase enzyme separase cleaves the cohesion complexes between the sister chromatids. Cleavage of the cohesin complexes in the region of the centromere releases the bond between both centromeres. This cleavage allows the sister chromatids to separate at", "2001.) cohesin chromatin loops of sister chromatids of one homolog along their entire lengths (see Figure 9\u201335). The pachytene stage can persist for days or longer, until desynapsis begins at diplotene with the disassembly of the synaptonemal complexes and the concomitant condensation and shortening of the chromosomes. It is only at this stage, after the complexes have disassembled, that the individual crossover events between nonsister chromatids can be seen as inter-homolog connections called chiasmata (singular chiasma), which now play a crucial part in holding the compact homologs together (Figure 17\u201357). The homologs are now ready to begin the process of segregation. Figure 17\u201356 Homolog synapsis and desynapsis during the different stages of prophase I.

When nondisjunction occurs at the time of meiosis, the gametes formed have either an extra chromosome (n + 1) or one less chromosome (n \u2212 1).

Loss of three nucleotides maintains the reading frame but can result in serious pathology. For example, cystic fibrosis (CF), a chronic, progressive, inherited disease that primarily affects the pulmonary and digestive systems, is most commonly caused by deletion of three nucleotides from the coding region of a gene, resulting in the loss of phenylalanine (Phe, or F; see p. 5) at the 508th", "next.

This difficulty is one of the main barriers to identifying all of the genes in a complete genome sequence, and it is one of the primary reasons why we know only the approximate", "the codon (the last base of the codon). This movement is called wobble and allows a single tRNA to recognize more than one codon. Examples of these flexible pairings are shown in Figure 32.9.

The comparative shrinkage of the mouse genome can be clearly seen from such comparisons, with the net loss of sequences scattered throughout the long stretches of DNA that are otherwise homologous (Figure 4\u201368).

Conversely, the rare mutations that confer a major reproductive advantage on individuals who inherit them can spread rapidly in the population.

The germ cells transmit genetic information from parent to offspring; the somatic cells form the body of the organism (Figure 5\u20131).

At Parkland Hospital, monochorionic twins undergo sonographic evaluation to assess interval growth every 4 weeks. In addition, a specific ultrasound examination to search for TTTS is completed at each intervening 2-week mark between these sonograms. For dichorionic pregnancies, a recent report suggests that sonographic evaluation every 2 weeks would identiY more abnormalities prompting delivery (Corcoran, 2015).

Palpating two fetal heads, often in diferent uterine quadrants, strongly supports a twin diagnosis. Late in the first trimester, two fetal heartbeats may be diferentiated with Doppler ultrasonic equipment if their rates are clearly distinct from each other and from that of the mother.

Fetuses with major malformations frequently have a single artery. Thus, its identiication often prompts consideration for targeted sonography and possibly fetal echocardiography. The most frequent anomalies are cardiovascular and genitourinary (Hua, 2010; Murphy-Kaulbeck, 2010). In an anomalous fetus, a single artery greatly increases the aneuploidy risk, and amniocentesis is recommended (Dagklis, 2010; Lubusky, 2007). If target sonography inds otherwise normal anatomy, an isolated single artery in an otherwise low-risk pregnancy does not significantly increase the fetal aneuploidy risk. However, as in isolated inding, it has been associated with fetal-growth restriction and perinatal death in some but not all studies (ChettyJohn, 2010; Gutvirtz, 2016; Hua, 2010; Murphy-Kaulbeck, 2010; Voskamp, 2013). hus, while clinical monitoring of growth is reasonable, the value of sonographic surveillance is unclear.", "incidence of congenital malformations is appreciably higher in multifetal gestations compared with that in singleton pregnancies. In one survey-based study, the congenital malformation rate was 406 per 10,000 twins compared with 238 per 10,000 singletons (Glinianaia, 2008). The malformation rate in monochorionic twins was almost twice that of dichorionic twin gestations. This increase has been attributed to the higher incidence of structural defects in monozygotic twins. Indeed, one large population-based study between 1998 and 2010 found that twins had a 73-percent greater risk of congenital heart disease than singletons. The risk was substantially higher among monochorionic twins (Best, 2015). But, from a 30-year European registry of multifetal births, structural anomaly rates rose steadily from 2.16 percent in 1987 to 3.26 percent in 2007 (Boyle, 2013).

In all cases, cloning refers to the act of making many identical copies, and in this section, we use the term to refer to methods designed to generate many identical copies of a defined segment of nucleic acid. DNA cloning can be accomplished in several ways. One of the simplest involves inserting a particular fragment of DNA into the purified DNA genome of a self-replicating genetic element\u2014usually a plasmid.

A DNA library is a collection of cloned restriction fragments of the DNA of an organism.

Other vectors: The development of improved vectors that can more efficiently accommodate larger DNA segments, or express the passenger genes in different cell types, has aided molecular genetics research and therapeutics. In addition to the prokaryotic plasmids described above, naturally occurring viruses that infect bacteria (bacteriophage \u03bb, for example) or mammalian cells (retroviruses, for example), as well as artificial constructs such as cosmids and bacterial or yeast artificial chromosomes (BAC or YAC, respectively), are currently used as cloning vectors.

This represents a very basic technique that is widely used in almost all areas of biomedical research. DNA vectors often are called plasmids, which are extrachromosomal molecules of DNA that vary in size and can replicate and be transmitted from bacterial cell to cell.

Two kinds of libraries are commonly used: genomic libraries and complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries. Genomic libraries ideally contain a copy of every DNA nucleotide sequence in the genome.

Conversely, the rare mutations that confer a major reproductive advantage on individuals who inherit them can spread rapidly in the population.

Sphingolipidoses In a normal individual, synthesis and degradation of glycosphingolipids are balanced, so that the amount of these compounds present in membranes is constant. If a specific lysosomal acid hydrolase required for degradation is partially or totally missing, a sphingolipid accumulates. Lysosomal lipid storage diseases caused by these deficiencies are called sphingolipidoses. The result of a specific acid hydrolase deficiency may be seen dramatically in nerve tissue, where neurologic deterioration can lead to early death.

IX. LYSOSOMAL GLYCOPROTEIN DEGRADATION Degradation of glycoproteins is similar to that of the GAG (see p. 163). The lysosomal acid hydrolases are each generally specific for the removal of one component of the glycoprotein. They are primarily exoenzymes that remove their respective groups in the reverse order of their incorporation (last on, first off). If any one degradative enzyme is missing, degradation by the other exoenzymes cannot continue. A group of very rare autosomal-recessive diseases called the glycoprotein storage diseases (oligosaccharidoses), caused by a deficiency of any one of the degradative enzymes, results in accumulation of partially degraded structures in the lysosomes."]}, {"id": "seed_task_9999", "name": "MMLU_test_medicalgenetics", "is_classification": true, "instruction": "In this task, you are given a question and four different answer options.

Recent evidence suggests that, in women with a history of three or more spontaneous pregnancy losses, a subsequent pregnancy loss has a 58% chance of chromosomal abnormality (15). Among women with recurrent pregnancy loss who are age 35 or older, the aneuploidy rate is much higher (8). The majority of chromosomal abnormalities identified in miscarriages are autosomal trisomies and considered to result from maternal nondisjunction.

A second involves preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) or preimplantation screening, and a third involves the use of donor gametes. Because chromosomal abnormalities are the most commonly identified cause of miscarriage, some have argued that the use of PGD is indicated for patients with recurrent pregnancy loss.

Compared with monosomies, chromosomal trisomies (e.g., trisomy 13, 18, and 21) appear to be tolerated a bit more readily, although mosaicism also may be implicated with these abnormalities. Neither family history alone nor a history of prior term births is sufficient to rule out a potential parental chromosomal abnormality. Whereas the frequency of detecting a parental chromosomal abnormality is inversely related to the number of previous spontaneous losses, the chance of detecting a parental chromosomal abnormality is increased among couples who have never experienced a live birth (13). Abnormalities also may be detected upon parental karyotype analysis of some couples with a history of spontaneous abortions interspersed with stillbirths and live births", "Approximately 60% of abortuses lost before 8 weeks of gestation were reported to be chromosomally abnormal; most of these pregnancies are affected by some type of trisomy, particularly trisomy 16 (318,319).

Aneuploid losses are particularly prevalent among women with recurrent pregnancy loss who are over the age of 35 (8). Although somewhat controversial, the detection of aneuploidy in miscarriage specimens may be less when the couple experiencing recurrent abortions is euploidic. Alternatively, some investigators have suggested that, because aneuploidy is common among miscarriage specimens from patients experiencing both isolated and recurrent spontaneous pregnancy losses, if aneuploidy is documented in fetal tissues from a recurrent pregnancy loss patient, this loss does not affect their", "Qenderny, 2014). Notably, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (20 16d) does not recommend routine use of chromosomal microarray testing of irst-trimester fetal tissues. However, these organizations, and the American Society for Reproduc tive Medicine (2012), recognize its value if cytogenetic analysis alters future care. Both abortion and chromosomal anomaly rates decline with advancing gestational age (Ammon Avalos, 2012; Eiben, 1990). Kajii and associates (1980) noted that 75 percent of chromo somally abnormal abortions occurred by 8 weeks' gestation. Of chromosomal abnormalities, 95 percent are caused by maternal gametogenesis errors, and 5 percent by paternal errors Qacobs, 1980). Most common abnormalities are trisomy, found in 50 to 60 percent; monosomy X, in 9 to 13 percent; and triploidy, in 11 to 12 percent (Eiben, 1980; Jenderny, 2014).", "errors Qacobs, 1980). Most common abnormalities are trisomy, found in 50 to 60 percent; monosomy X, in 9 to 13 percent; and triploidy, in 11 to 12 percent (Eiben, 1980; Jenderny, 2014). Trisomies typically result from isolated nondisjunction, rates of which rise with maternal age (Bow\u00a7, 1975). Trisomies of chromosomes 13, 16, 18, 21, and 22 are most common. In contrast, balanced structural chromosomal rearrangements may originate from either parent and are found in 2 to 4 percent of couples with recurrent pregnancy loss. Monosomy X (45,X) is the single most frequent specific chro mosomal abnormality. his is Turner syndrome, which usually results in abortion, but liveborn females are described in Chap ter 13 (p. 259).

Aneuploidy is the presence of one or more extra chromosomes, usually resulting in trisomy, or loss of a chromosomemonosomy. Data from population-based registries that include births, fetal deaths, and pregnancy terminations indicate an overall prevalence of 4 such abnormalities per 1000 births (Wellesley, 2012). Aneuploidy accounts for more than 50 percent of first-trimester abortions, about 20 percent of second-trimester losses, and 6 to 8 percent of stillbirths and early-childhood deaths (Reddy, 2012; Stevenson, 2004; Wou, 2016). Of recognized pregnancies with chromosomal abnormalities, trisomy 21 composes approximately half of cases; trisomy 18 accounts for 15 percent; trisomy 13, for 5 percent; and the sex chromosomal abnormalities-45,X, 47,XX, 47,Y, and 47,XY-for approximately 12 percent (Wellesley, 2012). The risk for fetal trisomy", "example, riski> 1 :30, are counseled and ofered invasive testing. Women at moderate risk, between 1 :30 and 1: 1500, undergo second-trimester screening, whereas those at lowest risk of < 1: 1500 receive negative screening test results and have no further testing (Cuckle, 2008). Using this strategy, more than 75 percent of those screened are provided with reassuring results almost immediately, while still maintaining a high detection rate of about 91 percent, with a 5-percent false-positive rate (see Table 14-4). his option is lso more cost efective because a second-trimester test is obviated in most patients. In a population-based review of 450,000 pregnancies from the California Prenatal Screening Program, integrated screening detected 94 percent of trisomy 21 fetuses and 93 percent with trisomy 18 (Baer, 2015).

IMMUNODEFICIENCY DISORDERS: PROOF OF PRINCIPLE Early attempts to effect gene replacement into hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) were stymied by the relatively low transduction efficiency of retroviral vectors, which require dividing target cells for integration. Because HSCs are normally quiescent, they are a formidable transduction target.

However, the translation of these findings into clinically useful tools presents special challenges.One of the main difficulties in getting gene therapy tech-nology from the laboratory to the clinic is the lack of a perfect delivery system. An ideal vector would be administered through a noninvasive route and would transduce all of the cancer cells and none of the normal cells. Furthermore, the ideal vector would have a high degree of activity, that is, it would produce an adequate amount of the desired gene product to achieve", "1) ex vivo, in which cells from the patient are removed, transduced, and returned, and 2) in vivo, in which the cells are directly transduced. Both types require use of a viral vector to deliver the DNA. Challenges of gene therapy include development of vectors, achievement of long-lived expression, and prevention of side effects such as an immune response. The first successful gene therapy involved two patients with severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) caused by mutations to the gene for adenosine deaminase (ADA, see p. 301). It utilized mature T lymphocytes transduced ex vivo with a retroviral vector (Fig. 34.26).

There are substantial difficulties in the development of live attenuated vaccines against HIV, not least the worry of recombination between vaccine strains and wildtype viruses that would lead to a reversion to virulence. An alternative approach is the use of other viruses, such as vaccinia or adenovirus, to deliver and express HIV genes that elicit Band Tcell responses against HIV antigens. Because these viral vectors have already demonstrated safety in other human vaccination studies, they have been obvious choices for initial trials.

This approach holds promise for effective treatment of what heretofore have been considered progressive and incurable diseases. It has been proposed that all degenerative diseases be classified according to their genetic and molecular abnormalities.

As sequencing technologies become less expensive, they can be expected to be more commonly used for both identifying mutations in patients with genetic disorders and screening asymptomatic individuals at risk of genetic disease. Another unique aspect of genetic testing is the concern that genetic information about individuals may be used to discriminate against them by employers or by insurance companies. In the United States, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA) prohibits the use of genetic information by employers in making decisions related to employment and by health insurance companies in issuing insurance policies or setting premium rates based on knowledge of the applicant\u2019s genetic status.

The final level of each protein in a eukaryotic cell depends upon the efficiency of each step depicted. The translation of the nucleotide sequence of an mRNA molecule into protein takes place in the cytosol on a large ribonucleoprotein assembly called a ribosome.

For example, we have seen that acquisition of cap-binding complexes, exon junction complexes, and poly-A-binding proteins mark the completion of capping, splicing, and poly-A addition, respectively. A properly completed mRNA molecule is also distinguished by the proteins it lacks. For example, the presence of an snRNP protein would signify incomplete or aberrant splicing. Only when the proteins present on an mRNA molecule collectively signify that processing was successfully completed is the mRNA exported from the nucleus into the cytosol, where it can be translated into protein.

The most powerful mRNA surveillance system, called nonsense-mediated mRNA decay, eliminates defective mRNAs before they move away from the nucleus. This mechanism is brought into play when the cell determines that an mRNA molecule has a nonsense (stop) codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA) in the \u201cwrong\u201d place. This situation is likely to arise in an mRNA molecule that has been improperly spliced, because aberrant splicing will usually result in the random introduction of a nonsense codon into the reading frame of the mRNA\u2014especially in organisms, such as humans, that have a large average intron size (see Figure 6\u201331B).

In eukaryotes, translational repressors can bind to the 5\u02b9 end of the mRNA and thereby inhibit translation initiation. Other repressors recognize nucleotide sequences in the 3\u02b9 UTR of specific mRNAs and decrease translation initiation by interfering with the communication between the 5\u02b9 cap and 3\u02b9 poly-A tail, a step required for efficient translation (see Figure 6\u201370).

If this recognition site differs substantially from the consensus recognition sequence (5\u02b9-ACCAUGG-3\u02b9), scanning ribosomal subunits will sometimes ignore the first AUG codon in the mRNA and skip to the second or third AUG codon instead. Cells frequently use this phenomenon, known as \u201cleaky scanning,\u201d to produce two or more proteins, differing in their N-termini, from the same mRNA molecule.

In some cases, parents need testing to exclude metabolic alterations seen in carriers for some of these disorders (such as some forms of homocystinuria) or because they might have a disorder themselves (such as glutaric acidemia type 1, methylcrotonyl coenzyme A carboxylase deficiency, or fatty acid oxidation defects). Some metabolic disorders can remain asymptomatic until adult age, presenting only when fasting or severe", "adult life. Such disorders, while uncommon, nevertheless are important because they must be considered in the differential diagnosis of degenerative diseases. Also to be considered in the differential diagnosis is an array of mitochondrial disorders, to be discussed further on in this chapter.

Feedings of uncooked cornstarch overnight are sufficient to maintain serum glucose concentrations in some patients. Defects in gluconeogenesis are uncommon and include fructose-1,6-diphosphatase deficiency and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase deficiency. Affected patients exhibit fasting hypoglycemia, hepatomegaly, lactic acidosis, and hyperuricemia. Ketosis occurs, and FFA and alanine concentrations are high. Treatment involves frequent high-carbohydrate, low-protein feedings (see Chapter 52).

A small number of progressive metabolic diseases become evident in the first few days of life. The importance of these diseases relates not to their frequency (they constitute only a small fraction of diseases that compromise nervous system function in the neonate) but to the fact that they must be recognized promptly if the infant is to be prevented from dying or from suffering a lifelong severe developmental delay. This inherent threat introduces an element of urgency into neonatal neurology. Recognition of these diseases is also important for purposes of family and prenatal testing.

Just as identification of APC mutations in FAP has provided molecular insights into the pathogenesis of a majority of sporadic colon cancers, dissection of the defects in HNPCC has shed light on the mechanisms responsible for most of the remaining sporadic cases. HNPCC is caused by inherited germ line mutations in genes that encode proteins responsible for the detection, excision, and repair of errors that occur during DNA replication. At least five such mismatch repair genes have been recognized, but a majority of HNPCC cases involve either MSH2 or MLH1.

On the other hand, testing should be offered in childhood for disorders that may manifest early in life, especially when management options are available. For example, children with multiple endocrine neoplasia 2 (MEN 2) may develop medullary thyroid cancer early in life and should be considered for prophylactic thyroidectomy (Chap. 408). Similarly, children with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) due to a mutation in APC may develop polyps in their teens with progression to invasive cancer in the twenties, and therefore, colonoscopy screening is started between the ages of 10 and 15 years (Chap. 110). Informed consent for genetic testing begins with education and counseling. The patient should understand the risks, benefits, and limitations of genetic testing, as well", "the specific genetic abnormalities underlying these disorders has led to significant interest in the role of genetic testing for colorectal cancer.9Tests for mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene responsible for FAP and in mismatch repair genes responsible for HNPCC are commercially available and extremely accurate in families with known mutations. However, in the absence of an identified mutation, a negative result is uninformative. For individuals from high-risk families without an identified mutation, increased surveillance is recommended.10 Although many of these mutations are also present in sporadic colorectal cancer, the accuracy of genetic testing in average-risk individuals is considerably lower, and these tests are not recommended for screening. Due to the potential psychosocial implications of genetic testing, it is strongly recommended that professional genetic counselors be involved", "need to be modified for patients who are at high risk. For example, more intensive colorectal cancer screening is recommended for individuals at increased risk because of a history of adenomatous polyps, a personal history of colorectal cancer, a family history of either colorectal cancer or colorectal adenomas diagnosed in a first-degree relative before age 60 years, a personal history of inflam-matory bowel disease of significant duration, or a family history or genetic test result indicating FAP or HNPCC.

Three stages of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia have been defined.

In essence, allelic heterogeneity reflects the fact that many different mutations are capable of altering protein structure and function.

Exceptions include (1) a founder effect, in which a particular mutation that does not affect reproductive capacity can be traced to a single individual; (2) \u201chot spots\u201d for mutations, in which the nature of the DNA sequence predisposes to a recurring mutation; and (3) localization of mutations to certain domains that are particularly critical for protein function.

Following such an occurrence, both gene copies would be required to provide the full range of functions that were once supplied by a single gene; hence, both copies would now be protected from loss through inactivating mutations.

Mutation detection Southern blotting can detect DNA mutations such as large insertions or deletions, trinucleotide repeat expansions, and rearrangements of nucleotides. It can also detect point mutations (replacement of one nucleotide by another; see p. 449) that cause the loss or gain of restriction sites. Such mutations cause the pattern of bands to differ from those seen with a normal gene. Longer fragments are generated if a restriction site is lost. For example, in Figure 34.13, person 2 lacks a restriction site present in person 1. Alternatively, the point mutation may create a new cleavage site with the production of shorter fragments.

Recombinant DNA technology has made possible a different type of genetic approach, one that is used widely in a variety of genetically tractable species. Instead of beginning with a mutant organism and using it to identify a gene and its protein, an investigator can start with a particular gene and proceed to make mutations in it, creating mutant cells or organisms so as to analyze the gene\u2019s function.

Sometimes, a double mutant will show a new or more severe phenotype than either single mutant alone. This type of genetic interaction is called a synthetic phenotype, and if the phenotype is death of the organism, it is called synthetic lethality. In most cases, a synthetic phenotype indicates that the two genes act in two different parallel pathways, either of which is capable of mediating the same cell process. Thus, when both pathways are disrupted in the double mutant, the process fails altogether, and the synthetic phenotype is observed.

Second, is evaluation of parental karyotype indicated-speciically, are the parents at increased risk of carrying this abnormality? If so, what is their risk of having future afected ofspring?

An important early step in the genetic analysis of any mutant cell or organism is to determine whether the mutation causes a loss or a gain of function. A standard test is to determine whether the mutation is dominant or recessive. A dominant mutation is one that still causes the mutant phenotype in the presence of a single copy of the wild-type gene. A recessive mutation is one that is no longer able to cause the mutant phenotype in the presence of a single wild-type copy of the gene.

Note that various point mutations in a single gene (e.g., COL2A1) can result in different phenotypes, whereas mutations in diverse genes (e.g., LRP5, RANKL) can give rise to similar clinical phenotypes.

Disorders of Autosomal Recessive Inheritance Disorders of autosomal recessive inheritance are manifested in the homozygous state.

Therefore, such disorders are characterized by the following features: (1) The trait does not usually affect the parents, who are carriers of one diseased allele, but multiple siblings may show the disease; (2) siblings have one chance in four of being affected (i.e., the recurrence risk is 25% for each birth); and (3) if the mutant gene occurs with a low frequency in the population, there is a strong likelihood that the", "mechanisms by which a 50% reduction in the levels of such proteins results in an abnormal phenotype are not fully understood. In some cases, especially when the gene encodes one subunit of a multimeric protein, the product of the mutant allele can interfere with the assembly of a functionally normal multimer. For example, the collagen molecule is a trimer in which the three collagen chains are arranged in a helical configuration. The presence of mutated collagen chains reduces the assembly of the remaining normal chains, producing a marked deficiency of collagen. In this instance the mutant allele is called dominant negative, because it impairs the function of a normal allele. This effect is illustrated in some forms of osteogenesis imperfecta (Chapter 21).

These defects might lie in different genes that function in the same process, or they might represent different mutations in the same gene. Alternative forms of the same gene are known as alleles.

Functional Consequences of Mutations Functionally, mutations can be broadly classified as gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations. Gain-of-function mutations are typically dominant (e.g., they result in phenotypic alterations when a single allele is affected). Inactivating mutations are usually recessive, and an affected individual is homozygous or compound heterozygous (e.g., carrying two different mutant alleles of the same gene) for the disease-causing mutations.

It can lead to the detection of undiagnosed medically actionable genetic conditions, but can also reveal deleterious mutations that cannot be influenced, as numerous sequence variants are of unknown significance. A general algorithm for the approach to mutational analysis is outlined in Fig. 82-15. The importance of a detailed clinical phenotype cannot be overemphasized. This is the step where one should also consider the possibility of genetic heterogeneity and phenocopies. If obvious candidate genes are suggested by the phenotype, they can be analyzed directly. After identification of a mutation, it is essential to demonstrate that it segregates with the phenotype.

Thus, most cells of an individual with an inherited loss-of-function mutation in a tumor-suppressor gene are functionally normal, and only the rare cells that develop a mutation in the remaining normal allele will exhibit uncontrolled regulation.

The answer to this question depends on the functional consequences of the mutation.

Conversely, the rare mutations that confer a major reproductive advantage on individuals who inherit them can spread rapidly in the population.

Important caveats are considered with selection of cell-free DNA aneuploidy screening. Because the cell-free DNA that is analyzed is maternal and placental, results may not relect the fetal DNA complement but rather may indicate con ined placental mosaicism, early demise of an aneuploid co twin, maternal mosaicism, or even occult maternal malignancy (Bianchi, 2015; Curnow, 2015; Grati, 2014; Wang, 2014).

Among the possible chromosomal monosomies, only that of the X chromosome typically permits viable offspring. On careful examination, however, many of these offspring may, in fact, exhibit mosaicism. Embryonic chromosomal monosomy may be particularly prevalent among patients with histories of recurrent pregnancy loss who are undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) (15).

Studies in such organisms have revealed rare cases in which the parceling out of genes violates the standard genetic rules. Occasionally, for example, meiosis yields three copies of the maternal version of a gene and only one copy of the paternal allele. Alternative versions of the same gene are called alleles, and it is the divergence from their expected distribution during meiosis that is known as gene conversion. Genetic studies show that only small sections of DNA typically undergo gene conversion, and in many cases only a part of a gene is changed. Several pathways in the cell can lead to gene conversion, but one of the most important arises from a particular consequence of recombination during meiosis.

Noninvasive prenatal testing has for the most part replaced invasive fetal testing. Amniocentesis is a procedure in which amniotic fluid is aspirated from the uterine cavity and sent for genetic or labora-tory testing typically under ultrasound guidance with a 20to 22-gauge needle. This procedure may be used to confirm abnor-mal noninvasive testing.Miscarriage and Pregnancy Terminations. Spontaneous pregnancy loss is common.

Women at moderate risk, between 1 :30 and 1: 1500, undergo second-trimester screening, whereas those at lowest risk of < 1: 1500 receive negative screening test results and have no further testing (Cuckle, 2008). Using this strategy, more than 75 percent of those screened are provided with reassuring results almost immediately, while still maintaining a high detection rate of about 91 percent, with a 5-percent false-positive rate (see Table 14-4). his option is lso more cost efective because a second-trimester test is obviated in most patients. In a population-based review of 450,000 pregnancies from the California Prenatal Screening Program, integrated screening detected 94 percent of trisomy 21 fetuses and 93 percent with trisomy 18 (Baer, 2015).

The choice of cut point may also depend on the likelihood of disease, with low likelihoods placing a greater emphasis on the harms of treating false-positive tests and higher likelihoods placing a greater emphasis on missed benefit by not treating false-negative tests. Unfortunately, there are no perfect tests. After every test is completed, the true disease state of the patient remains uncertain. Quantifying this residual uncertainty can be done with Bayes\u2019 rule, which provides a simple way to calculate the likelihood of disease after a test result or posttest probability from three parameters: the pretest probability of disease, the test sensitivity, and the test specificity.", "<20 weeks' gestation or with a fetal weight < 500 g. Mindful of this threshold, data from two large studies showed the risk for a subsequent miscarriage to be similar whether following two or three prior pregnancy losses (Bhattacharya, 2010; Brigham, 1999). And, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (2013) now deines RPL as two or more failed pregnancies conirmed by sonographic or histopathological examination. Primary PL refers to multiple losses in a woman who has never delivered a liveborn, and secondary PL refers to multiple pregnancy losses in a patient with a prior live birth.

The continuously updated OMIM catalogue lists several thousand of these disorders and provides information about the clinical phenotype, molecular basis, allelic variants, and pertinent animal models (Table 82-1). The mode of inheritance for a given phenotypic trait or disease is determined by pedigree analysis. All affected and unaffected individuals in the family are recorded in a pedigree using standard symbols (Fig. 82-11). The principles of allelic segregation, and the transmission of alleles from parents to children, are illustrated in Fig. 82-12. One dominant (A) allele and one recessive (a) allele can display three Mendelian modes of inheritance: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked.

In autosomal dominant disorders, individuals are affected in successive generations; the disease does not occur in the offspring of unaffected individuals. Males and females are affected with equal frequency because the defective gene resides on one of the 22 autosomes (Fig. 82-13A). Autosomal dominant mutations alter one of the two alleles at a given locus. Because the alleles segregate randomly at meiosis, the probability that an offspring will be affected is 50%. Unless there is a new germline mutation, an affected individual has an affected parent. Children with a normal genotype do not transmit the disorder.

Types of mendelian inheritance include autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked, and Y-linked. Other monogenic inheritance patterns, described subsequently, include mitochondrial inheritance, uniparental disomy, imprinting, and trinucleotide repeat expansion-also termed anticipation. By age 25, approximately 0.4 percent of the population exhibits an abnormality attributed to a monogenic disorder, and 2 percent will have at least one such disorder during their lifetime (Table 13-3). When considering inheritance, it is the phenotype that is dominant or recessive, not the genotype. With a dominant disease, the normal gene may direct the production of normal protein, but the phenotype is abnormal because it is determined by protein produced", "parents. In this situation, there is a 25% chance that the offspring will have a normal genotype, a 50% probability of a heterozygous state, and a 25% risk of homozygosity for the recessive alleles (Figs. 82-10, 82-13B). In the case of one unaffected heterozygous and one affected homozygous parent, the probability of disease increases to 50% for each child.

The risk of developing disease due to a mutant X-chromosomal gene differs in the two sexes.

Conversely, the rare mutations that confer a major reproductive advantage on individuals who inherit them can spread rapidly in the population.

Mutation detection Southern blotting can detect DNA mutations such as large insertions or deletions, trinucleotide repeat expansions, and rearrangements of nucleotides.

Such mutations cause the pattern of bands to differ from those seen with a normal gene. Longer fragments are generated if a restriction site is lost. For example, in Figure 34.13, person 2 lacks a restriction site present in person 1. Alternatively, the point mutation may create a new cleavage site with the production of shorter fragments.

But many other amino acid changes are effectively \u201cneutral,\u201d having neither a beneficial nor a damaging effect on the basic structure and function of the protein. In addition, since mutation is a random process, there must also have been many deleterious changes that altered the three-dimensional structure of these proteins sufficiently to harm them. Such faulty proteins would have been lost whenever the individual organisms making them were at enough of a disadvantage to be eliminated by natural selection. Protein families are readily recognized when the genome of any organism is sequenced; for example, the determination of the DNA sequence for the entire human genome has revealed that we", "we saw earlier, they account for most of the DNA sequence differences between apes and humans. The spread of neutral mutations is not as rapid as the spread of the rare strongly advantageous mutations. It depends on a random variation in the number of mutation-bearing progeny produced by each mutation-bearing individual, causing changes in the relative frequency of the mutant allele in the population. Through a sort of \u201crandom walk\u201d process, the mutant allele may eventually become extinct, or it may become commonplace. This can be modeled mathematically for an idealized interbreeding population, on the assumption of constant population size and random mating, as well as selective neutrality for the mutations.

For example, heterozygotes for the sickle cell gene are less susceptible to the severe malaria caused by the parasite Plasmodium falciparum. This organism spends an obligatory part of its life cycle in the RBC. One theory is that because these cells in individuals heterozygous for HbS, like those in homozygotes, have a shorter life span than normal, the parasite cannot complete the intracellular stage of its development. This may provide a selective advantage to heterozygotes living in regions where malaria is a major cause of death. For example, in Africa, the geographic distribution of sickle cell anemia is similar to", "dominant or recessive, not the genotype. With a dominant disease, the normal gene may direct the production of normal protein, but the phenotype is abnormal because it is determined by protein produced by the abnormal gene. With a recessive disease, a heterozygous carrier may produce detectable levels of an abnormal gene product but have no features of the condition because the phenotype is directed by the product of the normal co-gene. For example, erythrocytes from carriers of sickle-cell anemia contain approximately 30 percent hemoglobin S, but because the other 70 percent is hemoglobin A, these cells do not usually sickle in vitro.

In essence, allelic heterogeneity reflects the fact that many different mutations are capable of altering protein structure and function.

Exceptions include (1) a founder effect, in which a particular mutation that does not affect reproductive capacity can be traced to a single individual; (2) \u201chot spots\u201d for mutations, in which the nature of the DNA sequence predisposes to a recurring mutation; and (3) localization of mutations to certain domains that are particularly critical for protein function. Allelic heterogeneity creates a practical problem for genetic testing because one must often examine the entire genetic locus for mutations, because these can differ in each patient. For example, there are currently 1963", "protein, the final gene product, may be used to construct a nucleic acid probe using the genetic code as a guide. Because of the degeneracy of the genetic code (see p. 449), it is necessary to synthesize several oligonucleotides.

CNVs are responsible for several million base pairs of sequence difference between any two individuals. Approximately 50% of CNVs involve gene-coding sequences; thus, CNVs may underlie a large portion of human phenotypic diversity.

All of these findings indicate a strong genetic factor. The genes for bipolar disease remain to be discovered, and current thinking holds that several are likely to be involved.

By contrast, in most populations the probability that an unrelated donor will share the same two HLA haplotypes is very low. The implications of HLA polymorphism for transplantation are obvious; because each person has HLA alleles that differ to some extent from those of every other unrelated individual, grafts from unrelated donors will elicit immune responses in the recipient and be rejected. Only identical twins can accept grafts from one another, without fear of rejection.

In more than 90% of cases of Burkitt lymphoma, the cells have a translocation, usually between chromosomes 8 and 14, that leads to overexpression of the MYC gene on chromosome 8 by juxtaposition with immunoglobulin heavy chain gene regulatory elements on chromosome 14 ( Fig. 6.14 ).

Using the location of this chromosomal deletion, it was possible to clone and sequence the Rb gene.

X-linked OTC deficiency is the most common of these disorders, predominantly affecting males, although female carriers may become symptomatic. All of the other urea cycle disorders follow an autosomal-recessive inheritance pattern. In each case, the failure to synthesize urea leads to hyperammonemia during the first weeks following birth.

Five distinct forms of hyperphenylalaninemia, nine forms of homocystinuria, and methylmalonic acidemia are recognized. Such heterogeneity reflects the presence of a large array of molecular defects.

The other features have been mentioned above. Treatment of the hyperammonemic syndromes The treatment of acute hyperammonemic syndromes is directed at lowering ammonia levels, initially by hemodialysis, exchange transfusions, and administration of phenylacetate and sodium benzoate, which may divert nitrogen from the ureagenesis cycle or act as ammonia scavengers. A report of treatment for 299 patients treated with phenylacetate (or phenylbutyrate) and benzoate showed", "amino acid when arginine synthesis via the urea cycle is grossly impaired; thus arginine must be supplied except in the case of arginase deficiency.

Cystinuria is a disorder of renal tubular transport of cystine, lysine, arginine, and ornithine. Although intestinal transport is affected in some genetic forms, the symptoms are largely due to the renal transport abnormality. The concentration of cystine exceeds its solubility product and results in significant renal stones. Evaluation and diagnosis are based on the pattern of amino acid excretion in the urine.

Hyperornithinemia-hyperammonemia-homocitrullinemia (HHH) and intrinsic protein intolerance are closely related disorders.

Whatever the role of genes, it is clear that the environment plays a key role in obesity, as evidenced by the fact that famine prevents obesity in even the most obesity-prone individual.

Genetic contributions It is now evident that genetic mechanisms play a major role in determining body weight. 1. Biologic origin: The importance of genetics as a determinant of obesity is indicated by the observation that children who are adopted usually show a body weight that correlates with their biologic rather than adoptive parents. Furthermore, identical twins have very similar BMI (Fig. 26.5), whether reared together or apart, and their BMI are more similar than those of nonidentical, dizygotic twins. 2. Mutations: Rare, single gene mutations can cause human obesity. For example, mutations in the gene for leptin (causing decreased production) or its receptor (decreased function) result in hyperphagia (increased appetite for and consumption of food) and severe obesity (Fig. 26.6), underscoring", "risk of death from all causes compared to normal-weight CHAPTER 415e Biology of Obesity individuals, mostly due to cardiovascular causes. Obesity and overweight together are the second leading cause of preventable death in the United States, accounting for 300,000 deaths per year. Mortality rates rise as obesity increases, particularly when obesity is associated with increased intraabdominal fat (see above). Life expectancy of a moderately obese individual could be shortened by 2\u20135 years, and a 20to 30-year-old male with a BMI >45 may lose 13 years of life. It is likely that the degree to which obesity affects particular organ systems is influenced by susceptibility genes that vary in the population.

In contrast to polymorphisms, rare DNA variants\u2014those much less frequent in humans than SNPs\u2014can have large effects on the risk of developing some common diseases.

Painter and associates (2010) performed genomewide linkage analyses on more than 500 families of mothers of dizygotic twins and identified four potential linkage peaks. he highest peak was on the long arm ofchromosome 6, and other suggestive peaks were on chromosomes 7, 9, and 16.

But while useful as genetic markers, there is good evidence that most of these SNPs have little or no effect on human fitness. This is as expected, since deleterious variants will have been selected against during human evolution and, unlike SNPs, should therefore be rare. Against the background of ordinary SNPs inherited from our prehistoric ancestors, certain sequences with exceptionally high mutation rates stand out. A dramatic example is provided by CA repeats, which are ubiquitous in the human genome and in the genomes of other eukaryotes.", "In a third of cases, loss of one homologue leads to uniparental disomy. size or height. Abnormalities that display multifactorial inheritance tend to recur in families, but not according to a mendelian pattern. If a couple has had a child with a multifactorial birth defect, their empirical risk to have another afected child is 3 to 5 percent. This risk declines exponentially with successively more distant relationships. Multifactorial traits that have a normal distribution in the population are termed continuously variable.

For example, studies have shown that the possession of a BRCA mutation may increase the lifetime risk for ovarian or breast cancer some 30-fold. Although strength is a very important criterion, large-scale genetic studies suggest that other factors are equally important. For example, multiple studies reported several variants at the 8q24 chromosomal region associated with prostate and other cancers (12).

All of these findings indicate a strong genetic factor. The genes for bipolar disease remain to be discovered, and current thinking holds that several are likely to be involved.

Cell diversification does not always depend on extracellular signals: in some cases, daughter cells are born different as a result of an asymmetric cell division, in which some important molecule or molecules are distributed unequally between the two daughters. This asymmetric inheritance ensures that the two daughter cells develop differently (Figure 21\u201312). Asymmetric division is a common feature of early development, where the fertilized egg already has an internal pattern and cleavage of this large cell segregates different determinants into separate blastomeres. We shall see that asymmetric division also plays a part in some later developmental processes. Initial patterns are established in Small Fields of cells and refined by Sequential Induction as the embryo Grows The signals that organize the spatial pattern of cells in an embryo", "used repeatedly in different organisms and at different times during development. Not all cell diversification arises by cell\u2013cell interactions, however: daughter cells can be born different as a result of asymmetric cell division. Regulators of transcription and chromatin structure bind to regulatory DNA and determine the fate of each cell. Differences of body plan seem to arise to a large extent from differences in the regulatory DNA associated with each gene. This DNA has a central role in defining the sequential program of development, calling genes into action at specific times and places according to the pattern of gene expression that was present in each cell at the previous developmental stage.

But most of the genes", "the central question: how are the cells in different positions driven toward their different fates? We have already explained how maternal factors deposited in the developing frog egg define its animal-vegetal axis, and how cortical rotation triggered by fertilization defines the orientation of the dorsoventral axis (see Figure 21\u201314). But how does the establishment of axes lead on to the subdivision of the embryo into the future body parts? The maternal gene products lead to the formation of signaling centers on the vegetal and dorsal sides of the embryo. The dorsal signaling center in particular has a special place in the history of developmental biology. Experiments in the early twentieth century identified it as a small cluster of cells, located on the dorsal side of the amphibian embryo,", "structure can be traced in a similar way to changes in regulatory DNA. For example, these account for a large part of the dramatic difference between the wild teosinte plant and its modern descendant, maize, through some 10,000 years of mutation and selection by Native Americans. Drosophila has been the foremost model organism for the study of the genetics of animal development. Its embryonic pattern is initiated by the products of maternal-effect genes called egg-polarity genes, which operate by setting up graded distributions of transcription regulators in the egg and early embryo. The gradient of Bicoid protein along the A-P axis, for example, helps initiate the orderly expression of gap genes, pair-rule genes, and segment-polarity genes. These three classes of segmentation genes, through a hierarchy of interactions, become", "along the D-V axis. Together with the Bicoid group of genes, and acting in a broadly similar way, their gene products mark out three fundamental partitions of body regions\u2014head versus rear, dorsal versus ventral, and endoderm versus mesoderm and ectoderm\u2014 as well as a fourth partition, no less fundamental to the body plan of animals: the distinction between germ cells and somatic cells (Figure 21\u201317). The egg-polarity genes have a further special feature: they are all maternal-effect genes, in that it is the mother\u2019s genome rather than the zygote\u2019s genome that is critical. For example, a fly whose chromosomes are mutant in both copies of the Bicoid gene but who is born from a mother carrying one normal copy of Bicoid develops perfectly normally, without any defects in", "the A-P axis, each distinguished by a different pattern of gene expression. Molecular genetics has helped to reveal how this system works. a hierarchy of Gene regulatory Interactions Subdivides the Drosophila embryo Like Bicoid, most of the segmentation genes encode transcription regulator proteins. Their control by the egg-polarity genes and their actions on one another and on still other genes can be deciphered by comparing gene expression in normal and mutant embryos. By using appropriate probes to detect RNA transcripts or their protein products, one can observe genes switch on and off in changing patterns. By comparing these patterns in different mutants, one can begin to discern the logic of the entire gene control system. The products of the egg-polarity genes provide the global positional signals in the", "expression of genes such as Engrailed in neighboring cells (Figure 21\u201321). In such a manner, a series of sequential inductions creates a fine-grained pattern of gene expression within each segment. egg-polarity, Gap, and pair-rule Genes create a transient pattern that Is remembered by Segment-polarity and Hox Genes The gap genes and pair-rule genes are activated within the first few hours after fertilization. Their mRNA products initially appear in patterns that only approximate the final picture; then, within a short time, this fuzzy initial pattern resolves itself into a regular, crisply defined system of stripes. But this pattern itself is unstable and transient: as the embryo proceeds through gastrulation and beyond, the pattern disintegrates. The genes\u2019 actions, however, have passed on an enduring memory of their patterns of expression", "of the individual segments. Segmentation genes are expressed by subsets of cells in the embryo, and their products are the first components that the embryo\u2019s own genome contributes to embryonic development; they are therefore called zygotic-effect genes, to distinguish them from the earlier-acting maternal-effect genes. Mutations in segmentation genes can alter either the number of segments or their basic internal organization. The segmentation genes fall into three groups according to their mutant phenotypes (Figure 21\u201319). It is convenient to think of the three groups as acting in sequence, although in reality their functions overlap in time. First to be expressed is a set of at least six gap genes, whose products mark out coarse A-P subdivisions of the embryo. Mutations in a gap gene eliminate one or more", "First to be expressed is a set of at least six gap genes, whose products mark out coarse A-P subdivisions of the embryo. Mutations in a gap gene eliminate one or more groups of adjacent segments: in the mutant Kr\u00fcppel, for example, the larva lacks eight segments. Next comes a set of eight pair-rule genes. Mutations in these genes cause a series of deletions affecting alternate segments, leaving the embryo with only half as many segments as usual; although all the mutants display this two-segment periodicity, they differ in the precise pattern. Finally, there are at least 10 segment-polarity genes, in which mutations produce a normal number of segments but with a part of each segment deleted and replaced by a mirror-image duplicate of all or part of", "least 10 segment-polarity genes, in which mutations produce a normal number of segments but with a part of each segment deleted and replaced by a mirror-image duplicate of all or part of the rest of the segment.
