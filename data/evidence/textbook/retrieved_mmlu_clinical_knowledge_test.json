The volume of a typical cyst is 5 to 10 mL, but it may be 75 mL or more.

BRIEF INTRodUCTIoN To CLINICAL REASoNINg Clinical Expertise Defining \u201cclinical expertise\u201d remains surprisingly difficult.

Of", "talent and ability align, so leaders and organizations should be cognizant of choos-ing projects for which they have the potential to be the \u201cbest in the world\u201d at doing. Once the vision is set and the project is chosen, it is up to the leader to generate momentum.Momentum is either a cumulative effect of continuous steps towards improvement or, alternatively, in the negative sense, movements towards failure or stagnation. The \u201cflywheel effect,\u201d depicted in Fig. 1-8, demonstrates the building of momentum with (a) initial steps forward, (b) an accumulation of visible results, (c) realignment of the team in the new direc-tion (accounting for new information and data), and then (d) an accumulation of momentum followed by more steps forward.

Deliberate effortful practice (over an extended period of time, sometimes said to be 10 years or 10,000 practice hours) and personal coaching are two strategies that are often used outside medicine (e.g., music, athletics, chess) to promote expertise. Their use in developing medical expertise and maintaining or enhancing it has not yet been adequately explored. The modern ideal of medical therapeutic decision making is to \u201cpersonalize\u201d the recommendation. In the abstract, personalizing treatment involves combining the best available evidence about what works with an individual patient\u2019s unique features (e.g., risk factors) and his or her preferences and health goals to craft an optimal treatment recommendation with the patient.

Evidence is often constructed based upon measurement of outcomes such as morbidity, mortality, or survival; however, patients may be more concerned with quality of life or avoiding invasive inter-ventions.

Therefore, indirect treatment with intestinal diversion usually is required. The current options are loop ileostomy and sigmoid loop colostomy. The latter is preferred because it is quick and easy to perform, and provides essentially total fecal diversion. For sigmoid colostomy, technical elements include: (a) adequate mobilization of the sigmoid colon so that the loop will rest on the abdominal wall without tension, (b) maintenance of the spur of the colostomy (the common wall of the proximal and distal limbs after maturation) above the level of the skin with a one-half-inch Penrose drain or similar device, (c) longitudinal incision in the tenia coli, and (d) immediate matu-ration in the", "function may be poor.

Rarely, a loop ileostomy and decompressing colostomy may be necessary if the patient is too unstable to withstand colectomy.

Exercise is remarkable because of the lack of significant changes in blood gases. Except at maximal exertion, changes in PaCO2 and PaO2 are minimal during exercise. Arterial pH remains within normal values during moderate exercise. During strenuous exercise, arterial pH begins to fall as lactic acid is liberated from muscles during anaerobic metabolism. This decrease in arterial pH stimulates ventilation that is out of proportion to the level of exercise.

This is an energy-requiring (endergonic) pathway (both ATP and GTP get hydrolyzed) that occurs primarily in the liver, with the kidneys becoming major glucose producers in prolonged fasting. Gluconeogenesis uses both mitochondrial and cytosolic enzymes and is stimulated by a fall in the insulin/glucagon ratio.

This underscores the fact that skeletal muscle, despite its potential for transient periods of anaerobic glycolysis, is an oxidative tissue. A. Carbohydrate metabolism 1. Increased glucose transport: The transient increase in plasma glucose and insulin after a carbohydrate-rich meal leads to an increase in glucose transport into muscle cells (myocytes) by GLUT-4 (see p. 97 and Fig. 24.7, ), thereby reducing blood glucose. Glucose is phosphorylated to glucose 6-phosphate by hexokinase and metabolized to meet the energy needs of myocytes. 2.

In patients with diabetes, the ADA recommends 150 min/week (distributed over at least 3 days) of moderate aerobic physical activity with no gaps longer than 2 days. The exercise regimen should also include resistance training. Despite its benefits, exercise presents challenges for individuals with DM because they lack the normal glucoregulatory mechanisms (normally, insulin falls and glucagon rises during exercise). Skeletal muscle is a major site for metabolic fuel consumption in the resting state, and the increased muscle activity during vigorous, aerobic exercise greatly increases fuel requirements. Individuals with type 1 DM are prone to either hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia during exercise, depending on the preexercise plasma glucose, the circulating insulin level, and the level of exercise-induced catecholamines.", "Blood is then obtained at intervals of 1, 2, 4, 6, and 10 min for comparison with the baseline sample. A threeto fourfold rise of lactic acid is typical. The simultaneous measurement of ammonia serves as a control, because it should also rise with exercise. In patients with myophosphorylase deficiency or other glycolytic defects, the lactic acid rise will be absent or below normal, while the rise in ammonia will reach control values. If there is lack of effort, neither lactic acid nor ammonia will rise. Patients with selective failure to increase ammonia may have myoadenylate deaminase deficiency.

This decay represents the rapid and almost total failure of the fast motor units. The decline in force/stress is paralleled by depletion of glycogen and creatine phosphate stores and the accumulation of lactic acid. Of importance is that the decline in force/ stress occurs when the ATP pool is not greatly reduced, so that the muscle fibers do not go into rigor. In contrast, the slow motor units are able to meet the energy demands of fibers under this condition, and they do not exhibit significant fatigue, even after many hours.

As the arterial plasma glucose concentration falls below the physiologic range, blood-tobrain glucose transport becomes insufficient to support brain energy metabolism and function.

This corresponds to the weaknesses of the medial, superior, and inferior recti and the inferior oblique muscles. The remaining actions of the fourth and sixth nerves give rise to a position of the eye described by the mnemonic \u201cdown and out.\u201d The patient experiences diplopia in which the image from the affected eye is projected upward and medially.

A useful review of the approach to vertical diplopia is given by Palla and Straumann. Lesions of the sixth nerve result in a paralysis of the abducens muscle and a resultant weakness of lateral or outward movement leading to a crossing of the visual axes. The affected eye deviates medially, that is, in the direction of the opposing muscle. Diplopia is experienced as horizontal separation that is greatest when viewing in the direction of the sixth nerve palsy and in the distance (Fig 13-7A).

Many causes of", "nerve paresis may appear to have full eye movements despite a complaint of horizontal diplopia upon looking to the left. In this situation, the cover test provides a more sensitive method for demonstrating the ocular misalignment. It should be conducted in primary gaze and then with the head turned and tilted in each direction. In the above example, a cover test with the head turned to the right will maximize the fixation shift evoked by the cover test. Occasionally, a cover test performed in an asymptomatic patient during a routine examination will reveal an ocular deviation.

Most patients are attentive enough to open and close each eye and determine the source of the image thrown most outward in the field of maximal separation. There are several alternative methods for studying the relative positions of the images of the two eyes.

Thus the endothelium plays an important role in regulating blood flow to specific vascular beds. The metabolic activity of a tissue governs blood flow in that tissue. Any intervention that results in inadequate O2 supply prompts the formation of vasodilator metabolites that are released from the tissue and act locally to dilate the resistance vessels. When the metabolic rate of the tissue increases, or when O2 delivery to the tissue decreases, more vasodilator substances are released (see Chapter 17).

During skeletal muscle contraction, both (1) K+ and phosphate are released and (2) osmolarity is increased. Therefore, these factors may contribute to active hyperemia (increase in blood flow caused by enhanced tissue activity). However, significant increases in the phosphate concentration and in osmolarity are not always observed during muscle contraction, and they may increase blood flow only transiently. Therefore, they probably do not mediate the vasodilation observed during muscular activity. Potassium is released at the onset of skeletal muscle contraction or with an increase in cardiac muscle activity.

More Na is resorbed than K is secreted, so the secretion becomes hypotonic. When secretion is very rapid, more Na and less K appear in the final saliva because the reabsorption and secondary secretion systems cannot keep up with the rate of primary secretion. Thus, the saliva may become isotonic to hypertonic. The diameter of striated ducts often exceeds that of the secretory acinus.

Furthermore, reoxygenated venous blood obtained from active cardiac and skeletal muscles does not elicit vasodilation when the blood is infused into a test vascular bed. It is unlikely that oxygenation of venous blood alters its K+ or phosphate content or its osmolarity and thereby neutralizes its vasodilator effect.

The presence of four different bases provides surprising genetic diversity. In the protein-coding regions of genes, the DNA bases are arranged into codons, a triplet of bases that specifies a particular amino acid. It is possible to arrange the four bases into 64 different triplet codons (43).

How to translate a codon: This table can be used to translate any codon and, thus, to determine which amino acids are coded for by an mRNA sequence.

RNA is a linear polymer of four different nucleotides, so there are 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4 = 64 possible combinations of three nucleotides: the triplets AAA, AUA, AUG, and so on. However, only 20 different amino acids are commonly found in proteins. Either some nucleotide triplets are never used, or the code is redundant and some amino acids are specified by more than one triplet. The second possibility is, in fact, the correct one, as shown", "next. Because of this decoding, the information carried on mRNA relies on tRNA. Translation involves all three RNAs. The precise transfer of information from mRNA to protein is governed by genetic code, the set of rules by which codons are translated into an amino acid (Table 15-2). A codon, a triplet of three bases, codes for one amino acid. In this case, random combinations of the four bases form 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4, or 64 codes. Because 64 codes are more than enough for 20 amino acids, most amino acids are coded by more than one codon. The start codon is AUG, which also corresponds to methionine; therefore, almost all proteins begin with this amino acid.

A large ribosomal subunit then binds to complete the ribosome and begin protein synthesis. During this phase, aminoacyl-tRNAs\u2014each bearing a specific amino acid\u2014bind sequentially to the appropriate codons in mRNA through complementary base-pairing between tRNA anticodons and mRNA codons.

Second, the acylcarnitine is transported into the mitochondrial matrix in exchange for free carnitine by carnitine\u2013acylcarnitine translocase. Carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT-II, or CAT-II), an enzyme of the inner mitochondrial membrane, catalyzes the transfer of the acyl group from carnitine to CoA in the mitochondrial matrix, thus regenerating free carnitine. b.

The liver contains both isozymes.] Fatty acid oxidation is also regulated by the acetyl CoA/CoA ratio: As the ratio increases, the CoA-requiring thiolase reaction decreases (Fig. 16.17). nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. c.

However, the tricarboxylic acid cycle is inhibited by the rise in NADH, and the acetyl CoA is transported to the cytosol as citrate. The rise of acetyl CoA in the cytosol results in increased fatty acid (FA) synthesis. Recall that citrate is an allosteric activator of acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC). The malonyl product of ACC inhibits FA oxidation at the carnitine palmitoyltransferase I step. Because mitochondrial FA oxidation generates the acetyl CoA substrate for hepatic ketogenesis, ketone body levels do not rise. The FA gets esterified to the glycerol backbone, resulting in an increase in TAG that gets sent out of the liver as components of very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL). [Note: The hypoglycemia results", "step in fatty acid synthesis is the transfer of acetate units from mitochondrial acetyl CoA to the cytosol. Mitochondrial acetyl CoA is produced by the oxidation of pyruvate (see p. 109) and by the catabolism of certain amino acids (see p. 266). However, the CoA portion of acetyl CoA cannot cross the inner mitochondrial membrane, and only the acetyl portion enters the cytosol. It does so as part of citrate produced by the condensation of acetyl CoA with oxaloacetate (OAA) by citrate synthase (Fig. 16.6).

The use of glycerol for fuel depends on the availability of tissue glycerokinase, which is abundant in the liver and kidneys.Free fatty acids absorbed by cells conjugate with acyl-CoA within the cytoplasm. The transport of fatty acyl-CoA from the outer mitochondrial membrane across the inner mito-chondrial membrane occurs via the carnitine shuttle (Fig. 2-21). Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs), defined as those 6 to 12 carbons in length, bypass the carnitine shuttle and readily cross the mitochondrial membranes. This accounts in part for the fact that MCTs are more efficiently oxidized than LCTs. Ideally, the rapid oxidation of MCTs makes them less prone to fat deposition, particularly within immune cells and the reticu-loendothelial system\u2014a common finding with lipid infusion in parenteral nutrition.242 However, exclusive use of MCTs as fuel", "precursor. Fatty acid degradation (\u03b2-oxidation) occurs in mitochondria. The carnitine shuttle is required to transport long-chain fatty acids from the cytosol to the mitochondrial matrix.

Mitochondrial fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation produces acetyl CoA, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2). The first step in \u03b2-oxidation is catalyzed by one of four acyl CoA dehydrogenases, each with chain-length specificity. Medium-chain fatty acyl CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency causes a decrease in fatty acid oxidation (process stops once a medium-chain fatty acid is produced), resulting in hypoketonemia and severe hypoglycemia.

The rise in the NADH/NAD+ ratio shifts pyruvate to lactate and oxaloacetate (OAA) to malate, decreasing the availability of substrates for gluconeogenesis and resulting in hypoglycemia. The rise in NADH also reduces the NAD+ needed for fatty acid (FA) oxidation. The decrease in OAA shunts any acetyl coenzyme A produced to ketogenesis.

Spasticity, Hyperreflexia, and the Babinski Sign The identifying characteristics of paralysis from an upper motor neuron lesion are a predilection for involvement of certain muscle groups, a specific pattern of response of muscles to passive stretch (where resistance increases linearly in relation to velocity of stretch), and a manifest exaggeration of tendon reflexes.

Monoplegia with Muscular Atrophy This is more frequent than monoplegia without muscular atrophy. Long-continued disuse of one limb may lead to atrophy, but it is usually of lesser degree than atrophy caused by lower motor neuron disease (denervation atrophy). In disuse atrophy, the tendon reflexes are retained and nerve conduction studies are normal.

Nevertheless, the weakness tends to be disproportionate to atrophy. Usually, the tendon reflex is lost or muted in an affected region, but for unexplained reasons, some patients have one or more brisk reflexes. Our experience has been that this latter reflex change does not reach the point of appearing \u201cpathologic\u201d and that clonus and Babinski signs are categorically not part of the illness, as they are in ALS.

The reaction of the muscle to sudden stretch, as by tapping its tendon, is lost (areflexia). Damage restricted to only a portion of the motor fibers supplying the muscle results in partial paralysis, or paresis, and a proportionate diminution in the force and speed of contraction. The atrophy will be less and the tendon reflex reduced instead of lost. The electrodiagnosis of denervation depends upon finding fibrillations, fasciculations, and other abnormalities on needle electrode examination as mentioned in the previous chapter. However, some of these abnormalities do not appear until several days or a week or two after nerve injury. Lower motor neuron (infranuclear) paralysis is", "monoplegia of the leg). Infrequently monoplegia or fragments of it result from a restricted subcortical lesion that interrupts the motor pathways to one limb. A cerebral vascular lesion is the most common cause; a circumscribed tumor or abscess may have the same effect. Small cortical lesions in the motor strip may rarely be so selective as to cause restricted regions of weakness, for example, of parts of the hand. Multiple sclerosis and spinal cord tumor, early in their course, may cause weakness of one limb, usually the leg.

These signs also can occur with focal root or peripheral nerve disorders; thus, they are most useful when they occur together with signs of long tract damage.

Unilateral or bilateral weakness of the upper limb extensors and lower limb flexors (\u201cpyramidal weakness\u201d) suggests a lesion of the pyramidal tract, bilateral proximal weakness suggests myopathy, and bilateral distal weakness suggests peripheral neuropathy. \u2022 The bare minimum: Check the biceps, patellar, and Achilles reflexes.

In patients with myophosphorylase deficiency or other glycolytic defects, the lactic acid rise will be absent or below normal, while the rise in ammonia will reach control values. If there is lack of effort, neither lactic acid nor ammonia will rise. Patients with selective failure to increase ammonia may have myoadenylate deaminase deficiency.

When the energy demands of an exercising muscle cannot be met by oxidative metabolism, an oxygen debt is incurred.

This decay represents the rapid and almost total failure of the fast motor units. The decline in force/stress is paralleled by depletion of glycogen and creatine phosphate stores and the accumulation of lactic acid. Of importance is that the decline in force/ stress occurs when the ATP pool is not greatly reduced, so that the muscle fibers do not go into rigor. In contrast, the slow motor units are able to meet the energy demands of fibers under this condition, and they do not exhibit significant fatigue, even after many hours. Evidently, some factor associated with energy metabolism can inhibit", "most representative can be presented in a textbook of neurology. The Nature of Primary Metabolic Myopathies The chemical energy for muscle contraction is provided by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP); ATP is restored by phosphocreatine and ADP acting in combination. These reactions are particularly important during brief, high-intensity exercise. During periods of prolonged muscle activity, rephosphorylation requires the availability of carbohydrates, fatty acids, and ketones, which are catabolized in mitochondria. Glycogen is the main sarcoplasmic source of carbohydrate, but blood glucose also moves freely in and out of muscle cells as needed during sustained exercise. The fatty acids in the blood, derived mainly from adipose tissue and intracellular lipid stores, constitute the other major source of energy. Carbohydrate is metabolized during aerobic and", "in skeletal muscle is small and capable of supporting only a few contractions if not replenished. This pool, however, is continually replenished during contraction, as described later, so that even when the muscle fatigues, ATP stores are only modestly decreased. Muscle cells contain creatine phosphate, which is used to convert ADP to ATP and thus replenish the ATP store during muscle contraction. The creatine phosphate store represents the immediate high-energy source for replenishing the ATP supply in skeletal muscle, especially during intense exercise. The enzyme creatine phosphokinase catalyzes the reaction: Although much of the creatine phosphokinase is present in the myoplasm, a small amount is located in the thick filament (near the M line). The creatine phosphokinase in the thick filament may participate in the rapid resynthesis of", "of high-intensity exercise or prolonged exercise, the myoplasmic ATP level does not decrease substantially. In view of the reliance of all cells on the availability of ATP to maintain viability, fatigue has been described as a protective mechanism to minimize the risk of muscle cell injury or death. Consequently, it is likely that skeletal muscle cells have developed redundant systems to ensure that ATP levels do not drop to dangerously low levels and hence risk the viability of the cell. Most persons tire and cease exercise long before the motor unit fatigues. General physical fatigue may be defined as a homeostatic disturbance produced by work. The basis for the perceived discomfort (or even pain) probably involves many factors. These factors may include a decrease in plasma glucose levels", "is present in the myoplasm, a small amount is located in the thick filament (near the M line). The creatine phosphokinase in the thick filament may participate in the rapid resynthesis of ATP near the myosin heads during muscle contraction. The phosphate store created, however, is only about five times the size of the ATP store and thus cannot support prolonged periods of contraction (less than a minute of maximal muscle activity). Skeletal muscle fatigue during intense exercise is associated with depletion of the creatine phosphate store, although as described subsequently, this does not necessarily imply that the fatigue is caused by depletion of the creatine phosphate store. Because the creatine phosphokinase\u2013catalyzed reaction is reversible, the muscle cell replenishes the creatine phosphate pool during recovery from fatigue by", "can achieve an O2 consumption of 4 L/minute with a minute ventilation volume of 120 L/minute, which is almost 15 times the resting level. Exercise is remarkable because of the lack of significant changes in blood gases. Except at maximal exertion, changes in PaCO2 and PaO2 are minimal during exercise. Arterial pH remains within normal values during moderate exercise. During strenuous exercise, arterial pH begins to fall as lactic acid is liberated from muscles during anaerobic metabolism. This decrease in arterial pH stimulates ventilation that is out of proportion to the level of exercise.

There, it is dephosphorylated to glucose by glucose 6-phosphatase (the same enzyme used in the last step of gluconeogenesis; see p. 121). The glucose is then transported from the ER to the cytosol. Hepatocytes release glycogen-derived glucose into the blood to help maintain blood glucose levels until the gluconeogenic pathway is actively producing glucose.

A deficiency of the phosphatase causes glycogen storage disease Ia (von Gierke disease) and results in an inability of the liver to provide free glucose to the body during a fast. It affects both glycogen degradation and gluconeogenesis.

Key enzymes", "elongated by glycogen synthase. 2. Additional branch synthesis: After elongation of these two ends has been accomplished, their terminal six to eight glucosyl residues can be removed and used to make additional branches. IV. DEGRADATION (GLYCOGENOLYSIS) The degradative pathway that mobilizes stored glycogen in liver and skeletal muscle is not a reversal of the synthetic reactions. Instead, a separate set of cytosolic enzymes is required. When glycogen is degraded, the primary product is glucose 1-phosphate, obtained by breaking \u03b1(1\u21924) glycosidic bonds. In addition, free glucose is released from each \u03b1(1\u21926)\u2013linked glucosyl residue (branch point). A.

The hydrolysis reaction can be viewed as the transfer of the phosphate group to water. subunits in the large branched polysaccharide glycogen, which is present as small granules in the cytoplasm of many cells, including liver and muscle. The synthesis and degradation of glycogen are rapidly regulated according to need. When cells need more ATP than they can generate from the food molecules taken in from the bloodstream, they break down glycogen in a reaction that produces glucose 1-phosphate, which is rapidly converted to glucose 6-phosphate for glycolysis (Figure 2\u201352). Quantitatively, fat is far more important than glycogen as an energy store for animals, presumably because it provides for more efficient storage.

CHAPTER SUMMARY The main stores of glycogen in the body are found in skeletal muscle, where they serve as a fuel reserve for the synthesis of ATP during muscle contraction, and in the liver, where they are used to maintain the blood glucose concentration, particularly during the early stages of a fast. Glycogen is a highly branched polymer of \u03b1-D-glucose. The primary glycosidic bond is an \u03b1(1\u21924) linkage. After about 8\u201314 glucosyl residues, there is a branch containing an \u03b1(1\u21926) linkage. Uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose, the building block of glycogen, is synthesized from glucose 1-phosphate and UTP by UDP\u2013glucose pyrophosphorylase (Fig. 11.14). Glucose from UDP-glucose is transferred to the nonreducing ends of glycogen chains by primer-requiring glycogen synthase, which makes the \u03b1(1\u21924) linkages. The", "for gluconeogenesis. Thus gluconeogenesis requires an integration of catabolic pathways in adipocytes and skeletal myocytes with anabolic gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes. Gluconeogenesis eventually supplants glycogenolysis and can continue as long as precursors flow into the liver. Glucose sparing represents the other general process that contributes to maintenance of adequate circulating glucose levels during the fasting phase. Glucose sparing means the switching of fuel utilization from glucose to a nongluconeogenic fuel in most cell types, but especially in skeletal muscle, which represents the potentially largest single consumer of glucose.

Von Gierke disease (type I glycogenosis), resulting from a lack of glucose-6phosphatase, is the most important example of the hepatic form of glycogenosis ( Table 7.4 Myopathic type.

A unilaterally enlarged (\u201cHuthcinson\u201d) pupil is an early indicator of stretching or compression of the third nerve and reflects the presence of an overlying ipsilateral hemispheral mass as described earlier in the section on herniations. A loss of light reaction usually precedes enlargement of the pupil. As a transitional phenomenon, the pupil may become oval or pear-shaped or appear to be off center (corectopia) because of a differential loss of innervation of a portion of the pupillary sphincter. The light-unreactive pupil continues to enlarge to a size of 6 to 9 mm diameter and is soon joined by a slight outward deviation of the eye. In unusual instances, the pupil contralateral to the mass", "C2, C3) and effecting pupillary enlargement through cervical efferent sympathetic fibers. Extreme bilateral constriction of the pupils (miosis) is commonly observed with pontine lesions, presumably because of interruption of the pupillodilator fibers but the mechanism is not entirely clear. Narcotic ingestion is the most common cause of bilateral miosis in clinical practice except in the elderly, who often acquire small pupils, particularly if medication drops for glaucoma are being used. Interruption of the parasympathetic fibers causes an abnormal dilatation of the pupils (mydriasis), often with loss of pupillary light reflex; in cases of coma, the \u201cblown\u201d pupil (Hutchinson pupil) is the result of a midbrain lesion or direct compression of the oculomotor nerve (see Chap. 16). Other signs of oculomotor palsy are usually conjoined. As an ancillary test", "enlarge, the pupils become miotic, the eyes then cease roving and assume an aligned forward position, or there may be bilateral abducens palsies and limitation of upward gaze. The speed with which hydrocephalus develops determines whether there is accompanying papilledema. If this condition is left untreated, the pupils eventually dilate symmetrically, the eyes no longer respond to oculocephalic maneuvers, and the limbs become flaccid. Or, there is an unanticipated cardiac or respiratory arrest, even at an early stage of evolution of the hydrocephalus; this complication is seen particularly in children with masses, particularly at the foramen magnum, and may be presaged by brain compression at the level of the perimesencephalic cisterns, detectable by imaging studies. Treatment is by drainage of CSF, usually effected by a ventricular catheter or,", "of a recurrent unilateral headaches associated with weakness of extraocular muscles. A transient third-nerve palsy with ptosis, with or without involvement of the pupil, is the usual picture; rarely, the sixth nerve is affected. This disorder almost exclusively occurs in children. As a general rule, the diagnosis should not be made in adults unless there had been recurrent bouts in childhood. The ocular paresis often outlasts the headache by days or weeks; after many attacks, a slight mydriasis and some degree of ophthalmoparesis may remain permanently. We and others have encountered instances of gadolinium enhancement of the proximal, cisternal portion of the third nerve during and after an attack. However, in adults the syndrome of headache, unilateral ophthalmoparesis, and loss of vision may have more serious causes, including", "does not occur. For this reason, the ubiquitous abbreviation PERRLA (pupils equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation) implies a wasted effort with the last step. However, it is important to test the near response if the light response is poor or absent.

All patients with a decreased level of consciousness associated with focal findings should undergo an urgent neuroimaging procedure, as should all patients with coma of unknown etiology. Computed tomography (CT) scanning is usually the most appropriate initial study because it can be performed quickly in critically ill patients and demonstrates hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, and intracranial tissue shifts well. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may provide more specific information in some situations, such as acute ischemic stroke (diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI]) and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (magnetic resonance venography [MRV]). Any suggestion of trauma from the history or examination should alert the examiner to the possibility of cervical spine injury and prompt an imaging evaluation using plain", "day or days, it raises a limited number of diagnostic possibilities. Keane, who analyzed 60 such cases, found the responsible lesion to lie within the brainstem in 18 (usually infarction and less often Wernicke disease), in the cranial nerves in 26 (Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome or tuberculous meningitis), within the cavernous sinus in 8 (tumors or infection), and at the myoneural junction in 8 (myasthenia gravis and botulism). Our experience has tended toward the Miller Fisher variant of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, as did Keane\u2019s later series (2007), and myasthenia. The ophthalmoplegic form of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome is very frequently associated with circulating antibodies to GQ1b ganglioside (see Chap. 44).

Compression of the adjacent third ventricle leads to enlargement of the lateral ventricles that may require temporary drainage. Small and moderate-sized hemorrhages that rupture into the third ventricle have been associated with fewer neurologic deficits and better outcomes, but early hydrocephalus is common. Hemorrhage into the pons is almost invariably associated with deep coma within a few minutes; the remainder of the clinical picture is dominated by total paralysis with bilateral Babinski signs, decerebrate rigidity, and small (1 mm) pupils that react to light.

Intoxication with organophosphate insecticides, because of their capacity to induce a cholinergic crisis, may be confused with a myasthenic crisis (see further on). Certain other small clinical points may be helpful in differentiating myasthenia from other diseases that affect the cranial musculature. A hanging jaw and hanging head are indicative of myasthenia, whereas complete or asymmetric facial paresis is typical of GBS. Botulism usually affects the pupillary convergence reaction, and GBS does so only when there is complete internal and external ophthalmoplegia; diphtheria affects mainly the accommodative reaction early on.

Larger masses may produce local symptoms such as difficulty in swallowing. Individuals with toxic adenomas may present with features of thyrotoxicosis. After injection of radioactive iodine, most adenomas take up iodine less avidly than normal thyroid parenchyma. On radionuclide scanning, therefore, adenomas appear as cold nodules relative to the adjacent normal thyroid gland. Toxic adenomas, however, appear as warm or hot nodules in the scan. As many as 10% of cold nodules eventually prove to be malignant. By contrast, malignancy is uncommon in hot nodules. Essential techniques used in the preoperative evaluation of suspected adenomas are ultrasonography and fine-needle aspiration biopsy.

This may represent the more ready diagnosis of smaller cancers. The majority of cancers are found incidentally during routine examinations. Risk factors include a history of radiation exposure during childhood and family history. Signs include rapid growth of neck mass, new onset hoarseness, or vocal cord paralysis. In the setting of rapid growth, fixed nodule, new onset hoarseness, or the presence of lymphadenopathy, it is important to be sure a fine-needle aspiration is done. Thyroidectomy is the primary treatment with radioactive iodine and TSH suppression with thyroxine. Patients younger than 50 years of age with a primary tumor of less than 4 cm", "nodules have normal thyroid function tests. Nonetheless, thyroid function should be assessed by measuring a TSH level, which may be suppressed by one or more autonomously functioning nodules. If the TSH is suppressed, a radionuclide scan is indicated to determine if the identified nodule is \u201chot,\u201d as lesions with increased uptake are almost never malignant and FNA is unnecessary. Otherwise, the next step in evaluation is performance of a thyroid ultrasound for three reasons: (1) Ultrasound will confirm if the palpable nodule is indeed a nodule. About 15% of \u201cpalpable\u201d nodules are not confirmed on imaging, and therefore, no further evaluation is required. (2) Ultrasound will assess if there are additional nonpalpable nodules for which FNA may be recommended based on imaging features and size. (3) Ultrasound will", "approximately 50% of 60-year-olds. The vast majority of nodules when discovered are asymptomatic and benign; however, malignancy and hyperthyroidism must be excluded (52). Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration is recommended in the presence of the following factors: history of radiation to the head, neck, or upper chest; family history of thyroid cancer; ultrasound findings suggestive of malignancy; or a nodule larger than 1.5 cm in diameter (53). Thyroid function tests should be performed before fine-needle aspiration and, if results are abnormal, the underlying disease should be treated. Because most nodules are \u201ccold\u201d on scanning, it is more cost-effective to proceed with tissue sampling rather than scanning.

Functioning or \u201chot\u201d nodules are almost never malignant, and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy is not indicated. The vast majority of thyroid nodules do not produce thyroid hormone (\u201ccold\u201d nodules), and these are more likely to be malignant (~5\u201310%). Whole-body and thyroid scanning is also used in the treatment and surveillance of thyroid cancer. After thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer, the TSH level is raised by either using a thyroid hormone withdrawal protocol or recombinant human TSH injection (see below). Administration of 131I allows whole-body scanning (WBS) to confirm remnant ablation and to detect any functioning metastases. In addition, WBS may be helpful in surveillance of patients at risk for recurrence. Thyroid Ultrasound Ultrasonography is valuable for the diagnosis and evaluation", "a colloid nodule is diagnosed by FNAB, patients should still be observed with serial ultrasound and Tg measure-ments. If the nodule enlarges, repeat FNAB often is indicated. Although controversial, levothyroxine in doses sufficient to maintain a serum TSH level between 0.1 and 1.0 \u03bcU/mL may also be administered. In areas with a high prevalence of iodine deficiency, this can decrease nodule size and potentially prevent the growth of new nodules. In iodine-sufficient populations, the data are less impressive. Randomized controlled trial analyses have shown that less than 25% of benign nodules shrink more than 50% with TSH suppression in iodine-replete populations.

Lesions that are confirmed malignant on biopsy should be treated with extirpative surgery, and benign nodules should be palpated every 6 to 12 months. Thyroxine suppressive therapy for benign nodules is not recommended (53). Papillary thyroid carcinoma is the most common malignancy, found in 75% of thyroid cancers.

Thus the long delay, typically 28 to 35 ms after the stimulus (adjusted for height and age), reflects the cumulative time required for the impulses to reach the spinal cord via the sensory fibers, synapse with anterior horn cells, and to be transmitted along motor fibers to the muscle (see Fig. 3-1).

For all of these tests, the nerve or nerve root lesion is always on the side of the pain. The neurologic examination includes a search for focal weakness or muscle atrophy, focal reflex changes, diminished sensation in the legs, or signs of spinal cord injury. The examiner should be alert to the possibility of breakaway weakness, defined as fluctuations in the maximum power generated during muscle testing. Breakaway weakness may be due to pain or a combination of pain and an underlying true weakness. Breakaway weakness without pain is almost always due to a lack of effort.

The patient should be relaxed and the muscle positioned midway between full contraction and extension. Reflexes may be enhanced by asking the patient to voluntarily contract other, distant muscle groups (Jendrassik maneuver).

The size of the electrical response of a muscle to supramaximal electrical stimulation of its motor nerve relates to the number of muscle fibers that are activated. Neuromuscular transmission can be tested by several different protocols, but the most helpful is to record with surface electrodes the electrical response of a muscle to supramaximal stimulation of its motor nerve by repetitive (2\u20133 Hz) shocks delivered before and at selected intervals after a maximal voluntary contraction.

However, because the upper part of the nucleus receives motor input from the left and right cerebral hemispheres a lesion occurring above the nucleus leads to contralateral lower facial weakness.

The fourth nerve is particularly vulnerable to head trauma (this was the cause in 43 percent of 323 cases of trochlear nerve lesions collected by Wray from the literature). The reason for this vulnerability has been speculated to be the long, crossed course of the nerves. The fourth and sixth nerves are practically never involved by aneurysm. Herpes zoster ophthalmicus may affect any of the ocular motor nerves but particularly the trochlear, which shares a common sheath with the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve.

Several examples of phosphorylation reactions have been previously discussed (for example, see Chapter 11, p. 132, for the regulation of glycogen synthesis and degradation). 2.

Cystometrography may be performed 3 to 4 weeks after surgery. For the catheter to be discontinued, the patient must be able to sense the fullness of the bladder, initiate voiding, and void with a residual urine level of less than 75 to 100 mL.

Treatment The mainstay in the treatment of voiding difficulty is clean, intermittent self-catheterization (145). The most important protection against urinary tract infection is frequent and complete bladder emptying rather than avoiding the introduction of a foreign body into the bladder. Selfcatheterization allows the patient to accomplish this task using a small (14-Fr) plastic catheter that she inserts through the urethra into the bladder, draining its contents. The catheter is then removed, washed with soap and water, dried, and stored in a clean, dry place. Elaborate sterile procedures are not necessary.

If a woman cannot void after 4 hours, she should be catheterized and the urine volume measured. If more than 200 mL, the bladder is not functioning appropriately, and the catheter is left for another 24 hours. Although rare, if retention persists after a second voiding trial, an indwelling catheter and leg bag can be elected, and the patient returns in 1 week for an outpatient voiding trial. Intermittent sel-catheterization is another option (Mulder, 2017). During a voiding trial, if less than 200 mL of urine is obtained, the catheter can be removed and the bladder subsequently monitored clinically as described earlier. Harris and", "than after 14 days. In general, a 7to 14-day course of antibiotics is recommended, but further studies on the optimal duration of therapy are needed. In the setting of long-term catheter use, systemic antibiotics, bladder-acidifying agents, antimicrobial bladder washes, topical disinfectants, and antimicrobial drainage-bag solutions have all been ineffective at preventing the onset of bacteriuria and have been associated with the emergence of resistant organisms. The best strategy for prevention of CAUTI is to avoid insertion of unnecessary catheters and to remove catheters once they are no longer necessary. Evidence is insufficient to recommend suprapubic catheters and condom catheters as alternatives to indwelling urinary catheters as a means to prevent CAUTI. However, intermittent catheterization may be preferable to long-term indwelling urethral catheterization in certain populations (e.g., spinal cord\u2013injured", "outside of the catheter. Indwelling catheters facilitate direct access to the bladder and should have a closed drainage system. After simple, straight catheterization, the incidence of UTI is 1% to 2%. Organisms that cause catheter-associated UTIs include fecal flora, such as gram-negative enteric bacilli, most commonly Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus. With concomitant antibiotic treatment, resistant organisms predominate, and fungi emerge as pathogens. The most important aspect of prevention is to minimize the duration and use of catheterization. Intermittent catheterization is preferred over indwelling catheter drainage whenever feasible. Insertion of catheters must be performed with aseptic technique, and the drainage system must remain closed at all times, with sterile technique used whenever the system is entered.

Second, as in all nosocomial infections, at the time treatment is initiated on the basis of a positive culture, it is useful to repeat the culture to verify the persistence of infection. Third, the frequency with which UTIs occur may lead to the erroneous assumption that the urinary tract alone is the source of infection in a febrile hospitalized patient.

Superficial or first-degree burns should not be included when calculating burn size, and thorough cleaning of soot and debris is mandatory to avoid confusing soiled skin with burns. Examination of referral data suggests that physicians inexperienced with burns tend to overestimate the size of small burns and underestimate the size of large burns, with potentially detrimental effects on pretrans-fer resuscitation.11BURN CLASSIFICATIONBurns are commonly classified as thermal, electrical, or chemi-cal burns, with thermal burns consisting of flame,", "with pain, ery-thema, blistering, and blanching of skin. Topical dressings are the mainstay of treatment. Deep partial-thickness burns involve damage to the reticular dermis with damage to skin appendages, as well as the dermal plexus blood vessels and nerves. These have decreased sensation and no cap refill and appear pale or white. Blistering may be present. Damage to the skin append-ages and blood supply in the dermal plexus precludes spontane-ous healing without scar. Excision with skin grafting is needed. Third-degree burns involve full-thickness damage through the dermis and are insensate with no blistering. They appear dry, leathery, and even charred.Acute ManagementAdvanced trauma life support guidelines should be followed. After primary survey, circulation to the hand should be assessed.

The \u201crule of nines\u201d is a crude but quick and effec-tive method of estimating burn size (Fig. 8-1). In adults, the anterior and posterior trunk each account for 18%, each lower extremity is 18%, each upper extremity is 9%, and the head is 9%. In children under 3 years old, the head accounts for a larger relative surface area and should be taken into account when esti-mating burn size.

Principles behind choosing a dressing should balance ease of care, comfort, infection control, and cost. The choice of donor site dressing is largely institution dependent, and few data support the clear superiority of any single treatment plan.REHABILITATIONRehabilitation is an integral part of the clinical care plan for the burn patient and should be initiated on admission. Immediate and ongoing physical and occupational therapy is mandatory to prevent functional loss. Patients who are unable to actively participate should have passive range-of-motion exercises done at least twice a day. This includes patients with burns over joints, such as with hand burns. Patients should be taught exer-cises they can do themselves to maintain full range of motion. Patients with foot and extremity burns", "of a hand or wrist metastatic lesion must not interfere with treatment of the primary cancer. Treatment is usually palliative (simple excision or amputa-tion). The average life expectancy for these patients is less than 6 months.101BURNSThe palm of the hand makes up approximately 1% of the total body surface area. A burn involving the entire hand and digits is unlikely to cause life-threatening injury or shock, but seem-ingly small burns to the hand may cause severe permanent loss of function if not treated appropriately. Burns to the hand can cause serious shortand long-term disability. All burns to the hand are considered severe injuries that warrant transfer to a dedicated burn center for specialized treatment. This manage-ment will include a multidisciplinary team consisting of hand surgeons, burn surgeons, burn-specialized", "with nonoperative management, and the majority of deep partial-thickness burns benefit from excision and skin grafting. The outermost area of a burn is called the zone of hyperemia, which will heal with minimal or no scarring and is most like a superficial partial thickness burn or first-degree burn.Unfortunately, even experienced burn surgeons have lim-ited ability to accurately predict the healing potential of partial-thickness burns soon after injury; one reason is that burn wounds evolve over the 48 to 72 hours after injury.

Analysis of multiple risk factors for burn mortality has validated age and burn size as the strongest predictors of mortality.27 Advance-ments in burn care have lowered overall mortality to the point that the original Baux score may no longer be accurate.

It is important to establish the diagnosis of early AS before the development of irreversible deformity. This goal presents a challenge for several reasons: (1) Back pain is very common, but AS is much less common; (2) an early presumptive diagnosis often relies on clinical grounds requiring considerable expertise; and (3) young individuals with symptoms of AS often do not seek medical care.

They are applicable to individuals with \u22653 months of back pain with age of onset <45 years old. Active inflammation of the sacroiliac joints as determined by dynamic MRI is considered equivalent to definite radiographic sacroiliitis (see below). AS must be differentiated from numerous other causes", "days. In most instances the radicular pain subsides over a few weeks or less but severe or intractable cases may require surgery, especially if there is substantial weakness in the muscles corresponding to the affected root. Mild weakness alone is not recognized as an indication for surgery, and in those few cases where weakness alone has occurred, without pain, the same conservative measures outlined above should be considered. Most often the surgeon tackles this problem through an anterior approach (transdiscally), which leaves the posterior elements intact and allows for remaining stability of the spine but, if there is concern for future instability, a fusion of various types is added. Cervical Spondylosis (See Also Chap. 42) This is a chronic degenerative disease of the mid-and lower cervical spine that", "to conservative treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis, pain and overall function at 2 years was several-fold better in those who had operations (Weinstein et al, 2008). However, interpretation was hampered by a large number of patients who crossed over between arms of the study. Issues pertaining to the methodology of operation, particularly the need for fusion of the lumbar spine to limit mobility are of interest because of their increased cost over simple decompression but also because patients may query the neurologist about these matters. When there is spondylolisthesis and instability of adjacent segments, current opinion appears to favor fusion in order to reduce worsening spondylolisthesis and back pain. In the absence of slippage and instability, there is evidence from one trial that better patient satisfaction is attained", "preferences and needs (e.g., rapid return to employment) strongly influence decision making. Some patients will want the fastest possible relief and find surgical risks acceptable. Others will be more risk-averse and more tolerant of symptoms and will choose watchful waiting if they understand that improvement is likely in the end. The usual surgical procedure is a partial hemilaminectomy with excision of the prolapsed disk (diskectomy). Fusion of the involved lumbar segments should be considered only if significant spinal instability is present (i.e., degenerative spondylolisthesis). The costs associated with lumbar interbody fusion have increased dramatically in recent years. There are no large prospective, randomized trials comparing fusion to other types of surgical intervention.

Any degree of spasticity, sphincter disturbance, or loss of sensation in the hands will not improve or will improve little, and indeed usually worsens over months, without surgery. Hand weakness and muscular atrophy that is the result of radicular compression will improve with decompression of the appropriate root by one of several surgical approaches, but weakness that is from central cord damage requires decompression to halt the process and probably should not be delayed more than a few weeks once it is apparent that this is the problem.

It also increases the renal reabsorption of calcium, because PTH activates the renal hydroxylase that converts calcidiol to calcitriol. PTH also increases the renal excretion of phosphate.

Through billions of years of evolution, this sequence has been selected to give the protein a useful function. Thus, by folding into a precise three-dimensional form with reactive sites on its surface (Figure 1\u20137A), these amino-acid polymers can bind with high specificity to other molecules and can act as enzymes to catalyze reactions that make or break covalent bonds.

Conversely, the amino acid pool is depleted by three routes: 1) synthesis of body protein, 2) consumption of amino acids as precursors of essential nitrogen-containing small molecules, and 3) conversion of amino acids to glucose, glycogen, fatty acids, and ketone bodies or oxidation to CO2 + H2O (see Fig. 19.2).

Another simple procedure for quantitating purely vagal function consists of measuring the variation in heart rate during deep breathing (respiratory sinus arrhythmia). The ECG is recorded while the patient breathes at a regular rate of 6 breaths per minute.

A modest increase of ventilation is most efficiently achieved by increasing tidal volume but not respiratory rate, which is the normal ventilatory response to lower-level exercise. At high levels of exercise, deep breathing persists, but respiratory rate also increases. The pattern chosen by the respiratory controller minimizes the work of breathing.

However, the flow rates at lower lung volumes converge; this indicates that with modest effort, maximal expiratory flow is achieved. No amount of effort will increase the flow rates as lung volume decreases. For this reason, expiratory flow rates at lower lung volumes are said to be effort independent and flow limited because maximal flow is achieved with modest effort, and no amount of additional effort can increase the flow rate beyond this limit. In contrast, events early in the expiratory maneuver are said to be effort dependent; that is, increasing effort generates increasing flow rates.

Weakness, paralysis, or pain of the expiratory (abdominal and intercostal) muscles is foremost on the list of causes of impaired cough (Table 48-1).

By definition, an acute wound becomes chronic if healing is not achieved after 4 weeks of treatment. Acute wounds heal in a predictable man-ner and time frame as previously mentioned. The process occurs with few, if any, complications, and the end result is a well-healed wound. Surgical wounds can heal in several ways. An incised wound that is clean and closed by sutures is said to heal by primary intention.

Healing by primary union following application of sutures reduces the extent of the repair area through maximal closure of a wound, minimizing scar formation. Surgical incisions are typically made along cleavage lines; the cut tends to parallel the collagen fibers, thus minimizing the need for excess collagen production and the inherent scarring that may occur. Repair of the epidermis involves the proliferation of the basal keratinocytes in the stratum basale in the undamaged site surrounding the wound (Fig. F15.6.1). Mitotic activity is markedly increased within the", "upper layers of the dermis and epidermis. Absorbable deep dermal sutures have the advantage of disappearing over time; however, they can promote prolonged inflammation dur-ing this process. Nonabsorbable sutures minimize inflammation and might be indicated in individuals who are particularly prone to scar formation. A step-off between each side of the wound should be avoided because an uneven surface on each side of the wound can cause a shadow that accentuates the presence of the scar. Stability between the two wound edges is important because motion between the two sides of the wound prolongs the inflammatory phase of healing and requires additional col-lagen to be deposited.

Sutures placed at the surface that", "the fibroblasts progressively assume a more synthetic phenotype, and hence there is increased deposition of ECM. Collagen synthesis, in particular, is necessary for the healing wound to become strong and mechanically stable. Collagen synthesis by fibroblasts begins early in wound healing (days 3\u20135) and continues for several weeks, depending on the size of the wound. Net collagen accumulation depends not only on increased synthesis but also on diminished collagen degradation (discussed later). As the scar matures, there is progressive vascular regression, which eventually transforms the highly vascularized granulation tissue into a pale, largely avascular scar. http://ebooksmedicine.net Remodeling of Connective Tissue After the scar is formed, it is remodeled to increase its strength and contract it.

Sutures placed at the surface that go deep into the dermis can leave addi-tional scarring at the entry and exit points of the suture mate-rial in addition to the incisional scar. Sutures like this should be removed within the first week. If the superficial sutures are placed more shallowly in the dermis, there is a reduced tendency to form additional scarring.

This decay represents the rapid and almost total failure of the fast motor units. The decline in force/stress is paralleled by depletion of glycogen and creatine phosphate stores and the accumulation of lactic acid. Of importance is that the decline in force/ stress occurs when the ATP pool is not greatly reduced, so that the muscle fibers do not go into rigor. In contrast, the slow motor units are able to meet the energy demands of fibers under this condition, and they do not exhibit significant fatigue, even after many hours. Evidently, some factor associated with energy metabolism can inhibit", "fibers. Three types of fiber are typically found in any given skeletal muscle; the proportion of each type varies according to the functional role of the muscle. \u0081 Type I fibers or slow oxidative fibers are small fibers that appear red in fresh specimens and contain many mitochondria and large amounts of myoglobin and cytochrome complexes. Their high levels of mitochondrial oxidative enzymes are demonstrated by their strong succinic dehydrogenase and NADH-TR histochemical staining reactions as described previously (see Fig. 11.3). Type I fibers are slow-twitch, fatigue-resistant motor units (a twitch is a single, brief contraction of the muscle). These fibers have great resistance to fatigue but generate less tension than other fibers. Their myosin ATPase reaction velocity is the slowest of all of the fiber types. Type", "large fibers that appear light pink in fresh specimens and contain less myoglobin and fewer mitochondria than type I and type IIa fibers.

These fibers are fast-twitch, fatigue-prone motor units and generate high peak muscle tension. Their myosin ATPase velocity is the fastest of all the fiber types. They also fatigue rapidly as a result of production of lactic acid. Thus, type IIb fibers are adapted for rapid contraction and precise, fine movements. They constitute most fibers of the extraocular muscles and the muscles that control the movements of the digits.

Differences in patterns of vascular supply may permit some muscles to withstand the effects of vascular occlusion better than others.

The authors tend to agree with those who view intelligence as a general mental capability, embracing a number of primary abilities: the capacity to comprehend complex ideas, learn from experience, think abstractly, reason, plan, draw analogies, and solve problems.

All healthy persons can maintain some level of continuous muscular activity that is supported by oxidative metabolism.

This redundancy implies either that there is more than one tRNA for many of the amino acids or that some tRNA molecules can base-pair with more than one codon. In fact, both situations occur. Some amino acids have more than one tRNA and some tRNAs are constructed so that they require accurate base-pairing only at the first two positions of the codon and can tolerate a mismatch (or wobble) at the third position (Figure 6\u201351).

Basal Levels of 17\u03b1-Hydroxyprogesterone Basal levels of 17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone higher than 800 ng/dL are virtually diagnostic of CAH. Levels between 300 and 800 ng/dL require stimulatory testing with corticotropin to distinguish between PCOS and CAH. To complicate the situation even further, nonclassic 21-hydroxylase deficiency may occur even when basal levels of 17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone are below 300 ng/dL, thus requiring stimulatory testing in those cases. Cosyntropin Stimulation Test The most commonly used stimulatory test involves measurement of 17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone 30 minutes after administration of a bolus of 0.25 mg of synthetic cosyntropin (Cortrosyn) (96).

After metabolic enzymatic degradation in the peripheral tissues, IDL remains and is either catabolized in the liver by binding to LDL receptors or modified in the peripheral tissues. As noted previously, they are associated with apoprotein E receptors, the liver recognition receptors. The LDL cholesterol, or the so-called high-risk cholesterol, is found in high circulating levels. Despite the negative connotation of LDL in cardiovascular disease, it is a very important cellular metabolite and precursor for adrenocortical cells, lymphocytes, and renal cells.

Two general processes contribute to maintenance of blood glucose during the fasting phase: hepatic glucose production and glucose sparing.

The ability of peripheral tissues to export cholesterol via the transporter mechanism and the acceptor capacity of HDL are emerging as major determinants of coronary atherosclerosis. Lipoprotein disorders are detected by measuring lipids in serum after a 10-hour fast. Risk of heart disease increases with concentrations of the atherogenic lipoproteins, is inversely related to levels of HDL-C, and is modified by other risk factors. Evidence from clinical trials suggests that an LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) level of 50-60 mg/dL is optimal for patients with coronary disease. Ideally, triglycerides should be below 120 mg/dL.

The placental uptake and use ofLDL is an alternative mechanism for fetal assimilation of essential fatty acids and amino acids (Chap. 5, p. 103). LDL binds to specific receptors in the coated-pit regions of the syncytiotrophoblast microvilli. The large LDL particle, measuring about 250,000 Da, is taken up by a process of receptor-mediated endocytosis. The apoprotein and cholesterol esters of LD L are hydrolyzed by lysosomal enzymes in the syncytium to yield: (1) cholesterol for progesterone synthesis; (2) free amino acids, including essential amino acids; and (3) essential fatty acids, primarily linoleic acid. he placenta concentrates many amino acids in the syncytiotrophoblast, which are then transferred to the fetal side by difusion.

The creatine phosphate store represents the immediate high-energy source for replenishing the ATP supply in skeletal muscle, especially during intense exercise.

The amount excreted is proportional to the total creatine phosphate content of the body and, therefore, can be used to estimate muscle mass.

However, functional imaging studies indicate that various areas of the cerebrum are activated by dyspnea, mainly the insula and limbic regions. Many of the most interesting respiratory patterns observed in neurologic disease are found in comatose patients, and several of these patterns have been assigned localizing value, some of uncertain validity: central neurogenic hyperventilation, apneusis, and ataxic breathing.

Other causes of respiratory alkalosis, such as mild asthma, need to be diagnosed and treated before chronic hyperventilation can be considered. A high index of suspicion is required because increased minute ventilation can be difficult to detect on physical examination. Once chronic hyperventilation is established, a sustained 10% increase in alveolar ventilation is enough to perpetuate hypocapnia.

Shallow and irregular respirations, stertorous breathing (indicating obstruction to inspiration), and cyanosis require the establishment of a clear airway and delivery of oxygen. The patient should initially be placed in a lateral position so that secretions and vomitus do not enter the tracheobronchial tree. Secretions and vomitus should be removed by suctioning as soon as they accumulate; otherwise they will lead to atelectasis and bronchopneumonia. Arterial blood gases should be measured", "level of concomitant stimulation of respiration; small increases in respiration inhibit the vagal center slightly, whereas large increases in ventilation inhibit the vagal center more profoundly. An example of the primary inhibitory influence is shown in Fig. 18.10 . In this example, the lungs are completely collapsed, and blood oxygenation is accomplished with an artificial oxygenator. When the carotid chemoreceptors are stimulated, intense bradycardia and some degree of AV block ensue. Such effects are mediated primarily by efferent vagal fibers. The pulmonary hyperventilation that is ordinarily evoked by carotid chemoreceptor stimulation influences the heart rate secondarily, both by initiating more pronounced pulmonary inflation reflexes and by producing hypocapnia (see Fig. 18.9). Both influences tend to depress the primary cardiac response to chemoreceptor stimulation and thereby accelerate the heart", "alveolar ventilation, con-trolled by the respiratory centers in the pons and medulla oblongata.Respiratory Acidosis Respiratory acidosis is associated with the retention of CO2 secondary to decreased alveolar ventila-tion. The principal causes are listed in Table 3-11. Because compensation is primarily a renal mechanism, it is a delayed response. Treatment of acute respiratory acidosis is directed at the underlying cause. Measures to ensure adequate ventila-tion are also initiated. This may entail patient-initiated volume expansion using noninvasive bilevel positive airway pressure or may require endotracheal intubation to increase minute ven-tilation. In the chronic form of respiratory acidosis, the partial pressure of arterial CO2 remains elevated, and the bicarbonate concentration rises slowly as renal compensation occurs.Respiratory Alkalosis In the surgical patient, most cases of respiratory alkalosis are acute and secondary to", "volume and high pressures needed to achieve this goal has led to the acceptance of permissive hypercapnia. This condition is well tolerated when care is taken to avoid excess acidosis by pH buffering. Mode refers to the manner in which ventilator breaths are triggered, cycled, and limited. The trigger, either an inspiratory effort or a time-based signal, defines what the ventilator senses to initiate an assisted breath. Cycle refers to the factors that determine the end of inspiration. For example, in volume-cycled ventilation, inspiration ends when a specific tidal volume is delivered. Other types of cycling include pressure cycling and time cycling. The limiting factors are operator-specified values, such as airway pressure, that are monitored by transducers internal to the ventilator circuit throughout the respiratory cycle; if the", "nervous system disease may lead to seizures, coma, and central hypoventilation.

Hypoxia usually initiates the cascade leading to arrest and also produces organ dysfunction or damage (Table 38-3). The approach to cardiopulmonary arrest extends beyond CPR and includes efforts to preserve vital organ function. The goal in resuscitating a pediatric patient following a cardiopulmonary arrest should be to optimize cardiac output and tissue oxygen delivery, which may be accomplished by using artificial ventilation and chest compression and by the judicious administration of pharmacologic agents. In 2010 the American Heart Association revised the recommendations for resuscitation for adults, children, and", "role of endotracheal intubation is to protect or maintain the airway and ensure the delivery of adequate oxygen to the patient.

The clinician should deliver 100% oxygen at a rate of 8 to 10 breaths/min during CPR, or 12 to 20 breaths/min for a patient who has a perfusing rhythm. Use only the tidal volume necessary to produce visible chest rise. Care should be taken not to hyperventilate the patient.

As in basic life support, the major emphasis during ACLS is minimizing interruptions of chest compressions until ROSC is achieved.

The urinary excretion of potassium is not significantly increased, and depletion is probably the result of vomiting and diarrhea. In addition, serum levels of liver and muscle enzymes are markedly elevated. Biopsies from severely weakened muscles show single-fiber necrosis and vacuolation.

Initial elastic recoil forces blood both away from and back toward the heart. The flow of blood toward the heart causes the aortic and pulmonary valves to close. Continued elastic recoil then maintains continuous flow of blood away from the heart. The tunica intima of the elastic artery consists of endothelium, subendothelial connective tissue, and an inconspicuous internal elastic membrane.

The Cardiac Cycle The phase between the start of ventricular systole and opening of the semilunar valves (when ventricular pressure rises abruptly) is called the isovolumic (literally, \u201csame volume\u201d) contraction period. This term is appropriate because ventricular volume remains constant during this brief period (see Fig. 16.39 ). The onset of isovolumic contraction also coincides with the peak of the R wave on an ECG, initiation of the first heart sound, and the earliest rise in ventricular pressure on the ventricular pressure curve after atrial contraction.

Genetic or pharmacologic alterations of any component, whatever its etiology, can disturb these functions. The extent of shortening of heart muscle and, therefore, the stroke volume of the ventricle in the intact heart depend on three major influences: (1) the length of the muscle at the onset of contraction, i.e., the preload; (2) the tension that the muscle is called on to develop during contraction, i.e., the afterload; and (3) the contractility of the muscle, i.e., the extent and velocity of shortening at any given preload and afterload. The major determinants of preload, afterload, and contractility are shown in Table 265e-2.

The period between closure of the semilunar valves and opening of the AV valves is termed isovolumic relaxation. It is characterized by a precipitous fall in ventricular pressure without a change in ventricular volume. The major portion of ventricular filling occurs immediately after the AV valves open. At this point, the blood that returned to the atria during the previous ventricular systole is abruptly released into the relaxing ventricles. This period of ventricular filling is called the rapid filling phase.

The equilibrium values of Qh and Pv that prevail under a given set of conditions are determined by the intersection of the cardiac and vascular function curves. At very low and very high heart rates, the heart is unable to produce adequate Qh. At very low heart rates, the increase in filling during diastole cannot compensate for the small number of cardiac contractions per minute. At very high heart rates, the large number of contractions per minute cannot compensate for the inadequate filling time. 4.

The ATLS course refers to the primary survey as assessment of the \u201cABCs\u201d", "now standard practice. More than 90% of American patients die without cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and just as many forgo other potentially life-sustaining interventions.

On average, 3.8 interventions, such as vasopressors and transfusions, were stopped for each dying ICU patient. However, up to 19% of decedents in hospitals received interventions such as extubation, ventilation, and surgery in the 48 h preceding death.

A number of other factors, including glycogen depletion from a specialized compartment, a localized increase in [ADP], extracellular elevation of [K+], and generation of oxygen free radicals, have also been implicated in various forms of exercise-induced muscle fatigue. Finally, the central nervous system contributes to fatigue, especially in how fatigue is perceived by the individual. Regardless of whether the muscle is fatigued as a consequence of high-intensity exercise or prolonged exercise, the myoplasmic ATP level does not decrease substantially.

In view of the reliance of all cells on the availability of ATP to maintain viability, fatigue has been described as a protective mechanism to minimize the risk of muscle cell injury or death. Consequently, it is likely that skeletal muscle cells have developed redundant systems to ensure that ATP levels do not drop to dangerously low levels and hence risk the viability of the cell. Most persons tire and cease exercise long before the motor unit fatigues. General physical fatigue may be defined as a homeostatic disturbance produced by work.

These factors may include a decrease in plasma glucose levels", "in skeletal muscle is small and capable of supporting only a few contractions if not replenished. This pool, however, is continually replenished during contraction, as described later, so that even when the muscle fatigues, ATP stores are only modestly decreased. Muscle cells contain creatine phosphate, which is used to convert ADP to ATP and thus replenish the ATP store during muscle contraction. The creatine phosphate store represents the immediate high-energy source for replenishing the ATP supply in skeletal muscle, especially during intense exercise.

When the energy demands of an exercising muscle cannot be met by oxidative metabolism, an oxygen debt is incurred. Increased breathing during the recovery period after exercise reflects this oxygen debt.

This decay represents the rapid and almost total failure of the fast motor units. The decline in force/stress is paralleled by depletion of glycogen and creatine phosphate stores and the accumulation of lactic acid. Of importance is that the decline in force/ stress occurs when the ATP pool is not greatly reduced, so that the muscle fibers do not go into rigor. In contrast, the slow motor units are able to meet the energy demands of fibers under this condition, and they do not exhibit significant fatigue, even after many hours.

In view of the importance of preventing depletion of myoplasmic ATP, which would affect the viability of the cell,", "most representative can be presented in a textbook of neurology. The Nature of Primary Metabolic Myopathies The chemical energy for muscle contraction is provided by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP); ATP is restored by phosphocreatine and ADP acting in combination. These reactions are particularly important during brief, high-intensity exercise. During periods of prolonged muscle activity, rephosphorylation requires the availability of carbohydrates, fatty acids, and ketones, which are catabolized in mitochondria. Glycogen is the main sarcoplasmic source of carbohydrate, but blood glucose also moves freely in and out of muscle cells as needed during sustained exercise. The fatty acids in the blood, derived mainly from adipose tissue and intracellular lipid stores, constitute the other major source of energy. Carbohydrate is metabolized during aerobic and", "is present in the myoplasm, a small amount is located in the thick filament (near the M line). The creatine phosphokinase in the thick filament may participate in the rapid resynthesis of ATP near the myosin heads during muscle contraction. The phosphate store created, however, is only about five times the size of the ATP store and thus cannot support prolonged periods of contraction (less than a minute of maximal muscle activity). Skeletal muscle fatigue during intense exercise is associated with depletion of the creatine phosphate store, although as described subsequently, this does not necessarily imply that the fatigue is caused by depletion of the creatine phosphate store. Because the creatine phosphokinase\u2013catalyzed reaction is reversible, the muscle cell replenishes the creatine phosphate pool during recovery from fatigue by", "be defined as a homeostatic disturbance produced by work. The basis for the perceived discomfort (or even pain) probably involves many factors. These factors may include a decrease in plasma glucose levels and accumulation of metabolites. Motor system function in the central nervous system is not impaired. Highly motivated and trained athletes can withstand the discomfort of fatigue and may exercise to the point at which some motor unit fatigue occurs. Part of the enhanced performance observed after training involves motivational factors. Skeletal muscle fibers differentiate before they are innervated, and some neuromuscular junctions are formed well after birth. Before innervation, the muscle fibers physiologically resemble slow (type I) cells. Acetylcholine receptors are distributed throughout the sarcolemma of these uninnervated cells and are supersensitive to that neurotransmitter. An", "demands of burst activities such as weightlifting. The high myosin ATPase activity in fast muscle fibers and the increase in diffusion distance (resulting from the large diameter of the fast muscle fibers), however, increase the susceptibility of fast muscle fibers to fatigue. Additional differences between fast and slow muscles include the following: 1. The motor neuron in slow muscle is more easily excited than that in fast muscle, and so slow muscles are typically recruited first. As stated previously, the high oxidative capacity of slow muscle, coupled with the low myosin ATPase activity, helps reduce the susceptibility to fatigue in slow muscle. 2.

Presentation and Evaluation Patients commonly present to a physician for two reasons: bleeding and protrusion. Pain is less common than with fissures and, if present, is described as a dull ache from engorgement of the hemorrhoidal tissue. Severe pain may indicate a thrombosed hemorrhoid. Hemorrhoidal bleeding is described as painless bright red blood seen either in the toilet or upon wiping. Occasional patients can present with significant bleeding, which may be a cause of anemia; however, the presence of a colonic neoplasm must be ruled out in anemic patients. Patients who present with a protruding mass complain about inability to maintain perianal hygiene and are often concerned about the presence of a malignancy. The diagnosis of hemorrhoidal disease is made on physical examination.

Because colon neoplasms bleed intermittently and rarely present with rapid hemorrhage, the presence of occult fecal blood should always prompt a colonoscopy. Unexplained iron-deficiency anemia is also an indication for colonoscopy.Hematochezia is commonly caused by hemorrhoids or a fissure.

In the absence of a painful, obvious fissure, any patient with rectal bleeding should undergo a careful digital rectal examination, anoscopy, and proctosigmoidoscopy. Fail-ure to diagnose a source in the distal anorectum should prompt colonoscopy.Constipation and Obstructed Defecation. Constipation is an extremely common complaint, affecting more than 4 million people in the United States. Despite the prevalence of this prob-lem, there is lack of agreement about an appropriate definition of constipation. Patients may describe infrequent bowel move-ments, hard stools, or excessive straining. A careful history of these symptoms often clarifies the nature of the problem.Constipation", "in the rectosigmoid. For unexplained reasons, however, the proportion of large-bowel cancers arising in the rectum has been decreasing during the past several decades, with a corresponding increase in the proportion of cancers in the more proximal descending colon. As such, the potential for proctosigmoidoscopy to detect a sufficient number of occult neoplasms to make the procedure cost-effective has been questioned. Screening strategies for colorectal cancer that have been examined during the past several decades are listed in Table 110-3. Many programs directed at the early detection of colorectal cancers have focused on digital rectal examinations and fecal occult blood (i.e., stool guaiac) testing. The digital examination should be part of any routine physical evaluation in adults older than age 40 years, serving as a screening test for", "10\u201312 cm), results from direct rectal inoculation of typical STD pathogens. In contrast, inflammation extending from the rectum to the colon (proctocolitis), involving both the small and the large bowel (enterocolitis), or involving the small bowel alone (enteritis) can result from ingestion of typical intestinal pathogens through oral\u2013anal exposure during sexual contact. Anorectal pain and mucopurulent, bloody rectal discharge suggest proctitis or protocolitis. Proctitis commonly produces tenesmus (causing frequent attempts to defecate, but not true diarrhea) and constipation, whereas proctocolitis and enterocolitis more often cause true diarrhea. In all three conditions, anoscopy usually shows mucosal exudate and easily induced mucosal bleeding (i.e., a positive \u201cwipe test\u201d), sometimes with petechiae or mucosal ulcers.

Patients with a prostatic abscess will often have a history of recurrent sexually transmitted diseases. On physical examination, a large fluctuant area is usually readily visible. Routine laboratory evaluation shows an elevated white blood cell count. Diagnostic procedures are rarely necessary unless evaluating a recurrent abscess. A CT scan or MRI has an accuracy of 80% in determining incomplete drainage. If there is a concern about the presence of inflammatory bowel disease, a rigid or flexible sigmoidoscopic examination may be done at the time of drainage to evaluate for inflammation within the rectosigmoid region.

Physical examination can usually differenti-ate these conditions. Other, less common causes of anorectal pain include anal canal neoplasms, perianal skin infection, and dermatologic conditions. Proctalgia fugax results from levator spasm and may present without any other anorectal findings. Physical exam is critical in evaluating patients with anorec-tal pain. If a patient is too tender to examine in the office, an examination under anesthesia is necessary.

The incidence of unintended activation injuries can be reduced if the surgeon is always in direct control of electrode activation and if all electrosurgical hand instruments are removed from the peritoneal cavity when not in use.

Patients may be prescribed elastic stockings with compression ranging from 20 to 30, 30 to 40, or even 40 to 50 mmHg. Stockings range in length from knee high to waist high, and they should cover the symptomatic varices.

The murmurs of pulmonic stenosis and regurgitation behave in a fashion directionally similar to AS and AR; dynamic changes during respiration should be noted. Specific attributes of these cardiac murmurs are reviewed in Chap. 285. The electrocardiogram (ECG) may show evidence of ventricular hypertrophy and/or atrial enlargement.

Relative indications for which surgery can be considered include an abnormal response to treadmill exercise; rapid progression of AS, especially when urgent access to medical care might be compromised; very severe AS, defined by an aortic valve jet velocity >5 meters/s or mean gradient >60 mmHg and low operative risk; and excessive LV hypertrophy in the absence of systemic hypertension.

In some individuals (curve A in Fig. 19.20 ), this trend continues, and normal pressure is regained within a few hours. In others (curve B in Fig. 19.20 ), the pressure rises initially after the cessation of hemorrhage.

In an effort to improve cardiac output after volume resuscitation or when further volume replacement may be dangerous, a variety of inotropic and vasodilator drugs may be useful (Table 40-2). Therapy is directed first at increasing myocardial contractility, then at decreasing left ventricular afterload. The hemodynamic status of the patient dictates the choice of the agent.

For example, auscultation of the skull may rarely disclose a bruit (with large arteriovenous malformations); palpation may disclose the tender, hardened or elevated arteries of temporal arteritis; sensitive areas overlying a cranial metastasis or an inflamed paranasal sinus may be apparent; or there may be a tender occipital nerve. Examination of neck flexion may reveal meningitis; however, apart from such special instances, examination", "cardinal symptoms of pounding headache, photophobia, nausea, and vomiting are frequently present, perhaps reflecting the underlying biology of some of the patients. Meningitis is discussed in Chaps. 164 and 165. Acute, severe headache with stiff neck but without fever suggests subarachnoid hemorrhage. A ruptured aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation, or intraparenchymal hemorrhage may also present with headache alone. Rarely, if the hemorrhage is small or below the foramen magnum, the head CT scan can be normal. Therefore, LP may be required to definitively diagnose subarachnoid hemorrhage. Intracranial hemorrhage is discussed in Chap. 330. Approximately 30% of patients with brain tumors consider headache to be their chief complaint.

This technique has not been incorporated into routine evaluation because its sensitivity has not been established; our own experience suggests that it may miss cases, but it could be useful in choosing the site for biopsy of the temporal artery. The administration of prednisone, 45 to 60 mg/d in single or divided doses over a period of several weeks, is indicated in all cases, with gradual reduction to 10 to 20 mg/d and maintenance at this dosage for several months or years, if necessary, to prevent relapse. The headache can be expected to improve within a day or two of beginning treatment; failure to do so brings the diagnosis into question.

At times, the signs of meningeal irritation are so prominent as to raise the question of postlumbar puncture meningitis, although lack of fever usually excludes this possibility. In addition to a low or unmeasurable CSF pressure if another spinal tap is performed (the CSF pressure is found to be in the range of 0 to 60 mm H2O), there are occasionally a few to a dozen white cells in the CSF, which may further raise concern of meningitis. In the infant or young child, stiffness of the neck may be accompanied by irritability, unwillingness to move, and refusal of food. If the headache is protracted, recumbency still reduces it, but", "38 to 40\u00b0C (100.4 to 104\u00b0F), stiffness and aching in the muscles, sore throat in the absence of upper respiratory infection, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. These symptoms may subside to a varying extent, to be followed after 3 to 4 days by recrudescence of headache and fever and by symptoms of nervous system involvement; more often the second phase of the illness blends with the first. Tenderness and pain in the muscles, tightness of the hamstrings (spasm), and pain in the neck and back become increasingly prominent. Other early manifestations of nervous system involvement include irritability, restlessness, and emotional instability; these are frequently a prelude to paralysis. Added to these symptoms are stiffness of the neck on forward flexion and the characteristic CSF findings of aseptic meningitis. This", "a day or two of beginning treatment; failure to do so brings the diagnosis into question. When the sedimentation rate or CRP is elevated, its return to normal, usually over months, is a reliable index of therapeutic response. Whether symptoms or the blood tests are a better guide to reducing the steroid dose is unclear, one should probably be cautious in lowering the medication if the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and CRP remain high. Headaches of Pseudotumor Cerebri (Benign or Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension, See Chap. 29) The headache of pseudotumor cerebri assumes a variety of forms. Most typical is a feeling of occipital pressure that is greatly worsened by lying down, but many patients have\u2014in addition, or only\u2014headaches of migraine or tension type.

Diagnosis and management are based on a careful clinical approach augmented by an understanding of the 21 anatomy, physiology, and pharmacology of the nervous system pathways mediating the various headache syndromes.

Flow of blood through the heart is in one direction (unidirectional). Unidirectional flow through the heart is achieved by the appropriate arrangement of flap valves. Although cardiac output is intermittent, continuous flow to body tissues (periphery) occurs by distention of the aorta and its branches during ventricular contraction (systole) and by elastic recoil of the walls of the large arteries with forward propulsion of the blood during ventricular relaxation (diastole). The Cardiovascular Circuit In the normal intact circulation, the total volume of blood is constant, and an increase in the volume of blood in one area must be accompanied by a decrease in another. However, the distribution of blood circulating to the different regions of the body is determined by the output of the left ventricle and", "serve primarily as conduction tubes; however, they also facilitate the continuous and uniform movement of blood along the tube. Blood flow occurs as follows: The ventricles of the heart pump blood into the elastic arteries during systole (the contraction phase of the cardiac cycle). The pressure generated by contraction of the ventricles moves the blood through the elastic arteries and along the arterial tree. Simultaneously, it also causes the wall of the large elastic arteries to distend. The distension is limited by the network of collagenous fibers in the tunica media and tunica adventitia (Fig. 13.14). During diastole (the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle), when no pressure is generated by the heart, the recoil of the distended elastic arteries serves to maintain arterial blood pressure and the", "During diastole (the relaxation phase of the cardiac cycle), when no pressure is generated by the heart, the recoil of the distended elastic arteries serves to maintain arterial blood pressure and the flow of blood within the vessels. Initial elastic recoil forces blood both away from and back toward the heart. The flow of blood toward the heart causes the aortic and pulmonary valves to close. Continued elastic recoil then maintains continuous flow of blood away from the heart. The tunica intima of the elastic artery consists of endothelium, subendothelial connective tissue, and an inconspicuous internal elastic membrane. The tunica intima of elastic arteries is relatively thick and consists of the following. \u0081 In the endothelial lining with its basal lamina, the cells are typically flat and elongated,", "The early contraction of the apical part of the ventricles, coupled with the approximation of the ventricular walls, propels the blood toward the ventricular outflow tracts. The right ventricle, which develops a mean pressure that is approximately one seventh that developed by the left ventricle, is considerably thinner than the left ventricle. The cardiac valve leaflets consist of thin flaps of flexible, tough, endothelium-covered fibrous tissue that are firmly attached at the base to the fibrous valve rings. Movement of the valve leaflets is essentially passive, and the orientation of the cardiac valves is responsible for the unidirectional flow of blood through the heart. There are two types of valves in the heart: atrioventricular and semilunar ( Figs. 16.40 16.41 The tricuspid valve, located between the right atrium", "contraction depends on the initial length of the cardiac fibers. Using terminology that derives from early experiments using isolated cardiac muscle preparations, preload is the stretch of ventricular myocardial tissue just prior to the next contrac-tion. Strictly speaking, preload is determined by end-diastolic volume (EDV). In practice, EDV is challenging to measure precisely during the cardiac cycle, and so clinicians utilize the end-diastolic pressure (EDP) as a reasonable surrogate. For the right ventricle, central venous pressure (CVP) approximates right ventricular EDP. For the left ventricle, pulmonary artery occlusion pressure (PAOP), which is measured by transiently inflating a balloon at the end of a pressure monitoring catheter positioned in a small branch of the pulmonary artery, approxi-mates left ventricular EDP. The presence of atrioventricular val-vular stenosis may alter this", "right atrial blood reservoir. To hold venous return to the right atrium constant, the hydrostatic level of the blood reservoir was maintained. As Starling raised arterial pressure to a new constant level, the left ventricle responded at first to the increased afterload by pumping a diminished stroke volume. Because venous return was held constant, the diminution in stroke volume was accompanied by a rise in ventricular diastolic volume, as well as by an increase in the length of the myocardial fibers. This change in end-diastolic fiber length finally enabled the ventricle to pump a normal stroke volume against the greater peripheral resistance. As mentioned, a change in the number of cross-bridges between the thick and thin filaments probably contributes to this adaptation, but the major factor appears to", "the alternating filling and emptying of a volume chamber within the device that mimics the mechanism of action of the natural heart. Nonpulsatile devices have a mechanism of action that results in continuous blood flow through the device, eliminating the need for pulsatility. The pulsatile devices are larger, bulkier, and associated with greater energy requirements and higher rates of complications than the nonpulsatile devices. However, pulsatile devices provide greater degrees of support and may even be capable of replacing the function of the heart entirely in the form of a total artificial heart. Because of the bulkiness of these devices, many patients are too small to be supported with intracorporeal pulsatile pumps. However, paracorporeal versions are available.

The epicardial coronary arteries are sensitive, but concentric atheromas can prevent significant dilation. On the other hand, eccentric lesions permit an increase in flow when nitrates relax the smooth muscle on the side away from the lesion. Arterioles and precapillary sphincters are dilated least, partly because of reflex responses and partly because different vessels vary in their ability to release nitric oxide from the drug. A primary direct result of an effective dose of nitroglycerin is marked relaxation of veins with increased venous capacitance and decreased ventricular preload.

In every case, the physician is responsible for ensuring that the patient thoroughly understands these risks and benefits; encouraging questions is an important part of this process.

(a) When there is inadequate oxygen, for example, in a muscle cell undergoing vigorous contraction, the pyruvate produced by glycolysis is converted to lactate as shown.

The oxygen debt is much greater with strenuous exercise, when fast glycolytic motor units are used (Fig. 12.18 ). The oxygen debt is approximately equal to the energy consumed during exercise minus that supplied by oxidative metabolism (i.e., the darkand light-colored areas in Fig. 12.18 are approximately equal). As indicated earlier, the additional oxygen used during recovery", "of the TCA cycle, see p. 113) exceeds the oxidative capacity of the ETC. This results in an elevated NADH/NAD+ ratio, favoring reduction of pyruvate to lactate by LDH. Therefore, during intense exercise, lactate accumulates in muscle, causing a drop in the intracellular pH, potentially resulting in cramps. Much of this lactate eventually diffuses into the bloodstream and can be used by the liver to make glucose (see p. 118). 2. Lactate utilization: The direction of the LDH reaction depends on the relative intracellular concentrations of pyruvate and lactate and on the ratio of NADH/NAD+. For example, in the liver and heart, this ratio is lower than in exercising muscle. Consequently, the liver and heart oxidize lactate (obtained from the blood) to pyruvate. In the liver, pyruvate is", "glycogen, which are then metabolized by a combination of glycolysis (in the cytosol) and oxidative phosphorylation (in the mitochondria) to yield the equivalent of 37 mol of ATP per mole of glucose 1-phosphate. Blood glucose yields 36 mol of ATP per mole of glucose because 1 ATP is used to phosphorylate glucose at the start of glycolysis. These ATP yields, however, are dependent on an adequate oxygen supply. Under anaerobic conditions, in contrast, metabolism of glycogen and glucose yields only 3 and 2 mol of ATP per mole of glucose 1-phosphate and glucose, respectively (along with 2 mol of lactate). As discussed later, muscle fatigue during prolonged exercise is associated with depletion of glycogen stores in the muscle. Fatty acids represent an important source of energy for muscle", "aerobic exercise, blood flow to muscle and the availability of glucose and fatty acids are increased. At first, glucose is the main source of energy during exercise; later, with exhaustion of glycogen stores, energy is provided by oxidation of fatty acids. Thus, muscle failure at a certain phase of exercise is predictive of the type of energy failure. A rising blood concentration of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate reflects the increasing oxidation of fatty acids, and an increase in blood lactate reflects the anaerobic metabolism of glucose. The cytochrome oxidative mechanisms are essential in both aerobic and anaerobic muscle metabolism; these mechanisms are considered in Chap. 36 in relation to the mitochondrial diseases in which muscle tissue is prominently involved, and they are referred to here only briefly. It follows from these", "the use of different start sites in transcription (see p. 473) of the gene that encodes the enzyme. K. Pyruvate reduction to lactate Lactate, formed from pyruvate by LDH, is the final product of anaerobic glycolysis in eukaryotic cells (Fig. 8.21). Reduction to lactate is the major fate for pyruvate in tissues that are poorly vascularized (for example, the lens and cornea of the eye and the kidney medulla) or in RBC that lack mitochondria. 1. Lactate formation in muscle: In exercising skeletal muscle, NADH production (by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and by the three NAD+-linked dehydrogenases of the TCA cycle, see p. 113) exceeds the oxidative capacity of the ETC.

Handa and Laros (1993) diagnosed active-phase arrest, deined as no dilation for 2 hours or more, in 5 percent of term nulliparas. This incidence has not changed since the 1950s (Friedman, 1978).

In another 4 hours of labor, half required cesarean delivery. Rouse and colleagues (1999) prospectively managed 542 women at term with active-phase arrest and no other complications. Their protocol was to achieve a sustained pattern of at least 200 Montevideo units for a minimum of 4 hours. This time frame was extended to 6 hours if activity of 200 Montevideo units or greater could not be sustained. Almost 92 percent of these women were delivered vaginally.

Thus, there are several acceptable oxytocin protocols that at least appear dissimilar. But, a comparison of protocols from two institutions indicates that this is not so: 1. The Parkland Hospital protocol uses a starting dose of oxytocin at 6 mU/min, which is increased by 6-mU/min every 40 minutes, and employs flexible dosing based on uterine tachysystole. 2. The University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital protocol begins oxytocin at 2 mU/min and increases it as needed every 15 minutes to 4,8, 12, 16,i20,25, and 30 mU/min. hus, although the regimens at first appear disparate, if there is no uterine activity, either regimen is delivering 12 mU/ min by 45 minutes into the infusion.

The advantages of this technique are that it involves minimum additional surgery at the time of the mastectomy, has a recovery period essentially the same of that of the mastectomy alone, and creates no additional scarring. The disadvantages of this technique are the length of time necessary to complete the entire reconstruction (up to 1 year), the requirement for a minimum of two operative procedures, and a less predictable cosmetic result due to complete reliance on devices.

Regulation of Cardiac Output and Blood Pressure Four factors control cardiac output: heart rate, myocardial contractility, preload, and afterload ( Fig. 19.1). Heart rate and myocardial contractility are strictly cardiac factors, although they are controlled by various neural and humoral mechanisms. Preload and afterload are factors that are mutually dependent on function of the heart and the vasculature and are important determinants of cardiac output. Preload and afterload are themselves determined by cardiac output and by certain vascular characteristics. Preload and afterload are called coupling factors because they constitute a functional coupling between the heart and blood vessels.

Contractility determines the change in peak isometric force (isovolumic pressure) at a given initial fiber length (end-diastolic volume). Contractility can be augmented by drugs, such as norepinephrine or digitalis, or by an increase in contraction frequency (tachycardia). The increase in contractility (positive inotropic effect) produced by these interventions is reflected by incremental increases in the force developed and in the velocity of contraction. Indices of Contractility A", "release and then reaccumulate Ca2+, plays a fundamental role in the rhythmic contraction and relaxation of heart muscle. Genetic or pharmacologic alterations of any component, whatever its etiology, can disturb these functions. The extent of shortening of heart muscle and, therefore, the stroke volume of the ventricle in the intact heart depend on three major influences: (1) the length of the muscle at the onset of contraction, i.e., the preload; (2) the tension that the muscle is called on to develop during contraction, i.e., the afterload; and (3) the contractility of the muscle, i.e., the extent and velocity of shortening at any given preload and afterload. The major determinants of preload, afterload, and contractility are shown in Table 265e-2. The preload determines the length of the sarcomeres at", "volume (see Fig. 19.1 ). An increase in heart rate, for example, shortens the duration of diastole. Hence, ventricular filling is diminished; that is, preload is reduced. If an increase in heart rate altered cardiac output, arterial pressure would change; that is, afterload would be altered. A rise in heart rate would increase the net influx of Ca++ per minute into myocardial cells (see also ), and this influx would enhance myocardial contractility. The effects of changes in heart rate on cardiac output have been studied extensively, and the results are similar to those shown in Fig. 19.14 . As atrial pacing frequency is \u2022Fig. 19.14 Changesinstrokevolume(A) andcardiacoutput (B) inducedbychangesintherateofatrialpacing.(RedrawnfromKumadaM,etal.Jpn J Physiol. 1967;17:538.) gradually increased, stroke volume progressively diminishes (see Fig. 19.14A ). The decrease in stroke volume", "exerted at pressures and volumes entirely different from those in normal individuals. To assess changes in ventricular performance, the Frank-Starling mechanism is often represented by a family of ventricular function curves. To construct a control ventricular function curve, for example, blood volume is altered over a range of values, and stroke work (i.e., stroke volume \u00d7 mean arterial pressure) and end-diastolic ventricular pressure are measured at each step. Similar observations are then made during the desired experimental intervention. For example, the ventricular function curve obtained during infusion of norepinephrine lies above and to the left of the control ventricular function curve ( Fig. 18.12). Clearly, for a given level of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (an index of preload), the left ventricle performs more work during the norepinephrine infusion", "conditions with varied preload and afterload; contractility is maintained constant. Simultaneously halving aortic pressure and doubling cardiac output, or vice versa, result in the same value for cardiac work. However, the O2 requirements are greater for any given amount of cardiac work when a major proportion of the work is pressure work, as opposed to volume work. An increase in cardiac output at a constant aortic pressure (volume work) is accomplished with only a small increase in left ventricular O2 consumption, whereas increased CHAPTER 16 Elements of Cardiac Function arterial pressure at constant cardiac output (pressure work) is accompanied by a large increase in myocardial O2 consumption. Thus myocardial O2 consumption may not be well correlated with overall cardiac work. The magnitude and duration of left ventricular pressure", "point, the pressure developed will no longer increase. At very high filling pressures, peak pressure development in systole is actually reduced. At a constant preload, higher systolic pressure can be reached during ventricular contractions by an increase in the afterload (e.g., increasing aortic pressure by restricting the runoff of arterial blood to the periphery). Incremental increases in afterload produce progressively higher peak systolic pressures. However, if the afterload continues to increase, it becomes so great that the ventricle can no longer generate enough force to open the aortic valve. At this point, ventricular systole is totally isometric (i.e., there is no ejection of blood), and thus no change occurs in ventricular volume during systole. The maximal pressure developed by the left ventricle under these conditions is the maximal", "afterload is the pressure in the aorta that must be overcome by the contracting left ventricular muscle to open the aortic valve and eject the blood. Preload can be increased by greater filling of the left ventricle during diastole (i.e., increasing end-diastolic volume). From lower initial end-diastolic volumes, increments in filling pressure during diastole increase resting fiber length and elicit a greater systolic pressure during the subsequent contraction (see Fig. 16.36 ). Systolic pressure increases until a maximal systolic pressure is reached at the optimal preload (see Fig. 16.36 ). If diastolic filling continues beyond this point, the pressure developed will no longer increase. At very high filling pressures, peak pressure development in systole is actually reduced.

The net results of these actions are most apparent in the fasting state, when the supply of glucose from gluconeogenesis, the release of amino acids from muscle catabolism, the inhibition of peripheral glucose uptake, and the stimulation of lipolysis all contribute to maintenance of an adequate glucose supply to the brain.

Glucagon and epinephrine: Secretion of these counterregulatory hormones is most important in the acute, short-term regulation of blood glucose levels. Glucagon stimulates hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Epinephrine promotes glycogenolysis and lipolysis. It inhibits insulin secretion, thereby preventing GLUT-4\u2013mediated uptake of glucose by muscle and adipose tissues. Epinephrine assumes a critical role in hypoglycemia when glucagon secretion is deficient, for example, in the late stages of type 1 diabetes mellitus (see p. 340). The prevention or correction of hypoglycemia fails when the secretion of both glucagon and epinephrine is deficient. 2. Cortisol and", "begins if no food is ingested after the absorptive period. It may result from an inability to obtain food, the desire to lose weight rapidly, or clinical situations in which an individual cannot eat (for example, because of trauma, surgery, cancer, or burns). In the absence of food, plasma levels of glucose, amino acids, and TAG fall, triggering a decline in insulin secretion and an increase in glucagon, epinephrine, and cortisol secretion. The decreased insulin/counterregulatory hormone ratio and the decreased availability of circulating substrates make the postabsorptive period of nutrient deprivation a catabolic period characterized by degradation of TAG, glycogen, and protein. This sets into motion an exchange of substrates among the liver, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and brain that is guided by two priorities: 1) the need", "stimulating gluconeogenesis ( Fig. 43.10 ). Cortisol enhances gene expression of the key hepatic gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). Cortisol also decreases GLUT4-mediated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. During the interdigestive period (low insulin-glucagon ratio), cortisol promotes glucose sparing by potentiating the effects of catecholamines on lipolysis, thereby making FFAs available as energy sources. Cortisol inhibits protein synthesis and increases proteolysis, especially in skeletal muscle, thereby providing a rich source of carbon for hepatic gluconeogenesis.

Interestingly, although glucocorti-coid infusion alone does not increase glucose levels, it does pro-long and augment the hyperglycemic effects of catecholamines and glucagon when glucocorticoid is administered concurrently with the latter.Glycogen stores within skeletal muscles can be mobilized by epinephrine activation of b-adrenergic receptors, GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins), which subsequently activates the second messenger, cAMP. The cAMP activates phosphorylase kinase, which in turn leads to conversion of glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate. Phosphorylase kinase also can be activated by the second messenger, calcium, through the breakdown of phos-phatidylinositol phosphate, which is the case in vasopressin-mediated hepatic glycogenolysis.243Protein and Amino Acid MetabolismThe average protein intake in healthy young adults ranges from 80 to 120 g/d, and every 6 g of protein yields approximately 1 g", "PK to its inactive (phosphorylated) form.

An elliptical incision is created around the stoma and the bowel gently dissected free of the subcutaneous tissues and fascia.

The creation of an ileostomy bypasses the fluid-absorbing capability of the colon, and dehydration with fluid and electrolyte abnormalities is not uncommon. Ideally, ileos-tomy output should be maintained at less than 1500 mL/d to avoid this problem. Bulk agents and opioids (Lomotil, Imodium, tincture of opium) are useful.

Therefore, indirect treatment with intestinal diversion usually is required. The current options are loop ileostomy and sigmoid loop colostomy. The latter is preferred because it is quick and easy to perform, and provides essentially total fecal diversion. For sigmoid colostomy, technical elements include: (a) adequate mobilization of the sigmoid colon so that the loop will rest on the abdominal wall without tension, (b) maintenance of the spur of the colostomy (the common wall of the proximal and distal limbs after maturation) above the level of the skin with a one-half-inch Penrose drain or similar device, (c) longitudinal incision in the tenia coli, and (d) immediate matu-ration in the", "without compromising the intestinal blood supply (usually the width of two to three fingers). The bowel is then brought through the defect and secured with sutures. The abdominal incision is usually closed and dressed prior to maturing the stoma to avoid contaminating the wound. In order to make appliance use easier, a protruding nipple is fashioned by everting the bowel. Three or four interrupted absorbable sutures are placed through the edge of the bowel, then through the serosa, approximately 2 cm proximal to the edge, and then through the dermis (Brooke tech-nique). After the stoma is everted, the mucocutaneous junction is sutured circumferentially with interrupted absorbable suture (Fig. 29-16).Ileostomy Temporary Ileostomy A temporary ileostomy is often used to \u201cprotect\u201d an anastomosis that is at risk for leakage (low", "than with an ileostomy because the stool is less irritating to the skin than succus entericus.

Parastomal hernia is less common after an ileostomy than after a colostomy but can cause poor appliance fitting, pain, obstruction, or strangulation. In general, symptomatic parastomal hernias should be repaired. A variety of techniques to repair these hernias have been described, including local repair (either with or without mesh), laparoscopic repair, and stoma resiting.

Blood glucose yields 36 mol of ATP per mole of glucose because 1 ATP is used to phosphorylate glucose at the start of glycolysis. These ATP yields, however, are dependent on an adequate oxygen supply. Under anaerobic conditions, in contrast, metabolism of glycogen and glucose yields only 3 and 2 mol of ATP per mole of glucose 1-phosphate and glucose, respectively (along with 2 mol of lactate). As discussed later, muscle fatigue during prolonged exercise is associated with depletion of glycogen stores in the muscle. Fatty acids represent an important source of energy for muscle", "most representative can be presented in a textbook of neurology. The Nature of Primary Metabolic Myopathies The chemical energy for muscle contraction is provided by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP); ATP is restored by phosphocreatine and ADP acting in combination. These reactions are particularly important during brief, high-intensity exercise. During periods of prolonged muscle activity, rephosphorylation requires the availability of carbohydrates, fatty acids, and ketones, which are catabolized in mitochondria. Glycogen is the main sarcoplasmic source of carbohydrate, but blood glucose also moves freely in and out of muscle cells as needed during sustained exercise. The fatty acids in the blood, derived mainly from adipose tissue and intracellular lipid stores, constitute the other major source of energy. Carbohydrate is metabolized during aerobic and", "the lactate generated by glycolysis. The increased cardiac and respiratory work during recovery also contributes to the increased oxygen consumption seen at this time and explains why more oxygen has to be \u201crepaid\u201d than was \u201cborrowed.\u201d Some oxygen debt occurs even with low levels of exercise because slow oxidative motor units consume considerable ATP, derived from creatine phosphate or glycolysis, before oxidative metabolism can increase ATP production to meet steady-state requirements. The oxygen debt is much greater with strenuous exercise, when fast glycolytic motor units are used (Fig. 12.18 ). The oxygen debt is approximately equal to the energy consumed during exercise minus that supplied by oxidative metabolism (i.e., the darkand light-colored areas in Fig. 12.18 are approximately equal).

A growing tumor needs nutrients in abundance to provide the building blocks to make new macromolecules. Correspondingly, most tumors have a metabolism more similar to that of a growing embryo than to that of normal adult tissue. Tumor cells consume glucose avidly, importing it from the blood at a rate that can be as much as 100 times higher than neighboring normal cells. Moreover, only a small fraction of this imported glucose is used for production of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. Instead, a great deal of lactate is produced, and many of the remaining carbon atoms derived from glucose are diverted for use as raw materials for synthesis", "Energy Production by Oxidative Metabolism.

This decay represents the rapid and almost total failure of the fast motor units. The decline in force/stress is paralleled by depletion of glycogen and creatine phosphate stores and the accumulation of lactic acid. Of importance is that the decline in force/ stress occurs when the ATP pool is not greatly reduced, so that the muscle fibers do not go into rigor. In contrast, the slow motor units are able to meet the energy demands of fibers under this condition, and they do not exhibit significant fatigue, even after many hours. Evidently, some factor associated with energy metabolism can inhibit", "although the accumulation of various metabolic products (lactate, Pi, ADP) has been implicated. In view of the importance of preventing depletion of myoplasmic ATP, which would affect the viability of the cell, it is likely that multiple mechanisms may have been developed to induce fatigue and hence lower the rate of ATP hydrolysis before the individual risks injury or death of the skeletal muscle cell. 11. When the energy demands of an exercising muscle cannot be met by oxidative metabolism, an oxygen debt is incurred. Increased breathing during the recovery period after exercise reflects this oxygen debt.

The most appropriate time to introduce levodopa therapy must therefore be determined individually. When levodopa is used, it is generally given in combination with carbidopa (Figure 28\u20133), a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor, which reduces peripheral conversion to dopamine.

In general, an adequate dose of whichever agent is chosen should be used as soon as possible after the onset of an attack. If additional medication is required within 60 min because symptoms return or have not abated, the initial dose should be increased for subsequent attacks or a different class of drug tried as first-line treatment.

Augmentation refers to the earlier onset or enhancement of symptoms; earlier onset of symptoms at rest; and a briefer response to medication. When augmentation occurs with levodopa, a dopamine agonist should be substituted.

Dopamine agonist therapy may be associated with development of impulse control disorders. Gabapentin is effective in reducing the severity of restless legs syndrome and is taken once or twice daily (in the evening and before sleep).

In the rare event that they must be used by a potentially suicidal patient, the patient must be given only a few pills at a time (121). Some medication plans, private or public, require that treatment begin with the least expensive generic medication, and that the patient first fail with that medication before a newer compound will be provided.

Any acute change in bowel habits must be evaluated thoroughly, and malignancy must be considered in the differential diagnosis. Even in the presence of chronic disease, malignancy must still be excluded.

Screening strategies for colorectal cancer that have been examined during the past several decades are listed in Table 110-3.

Wound Care The abdominal incision normally requires little attention, except for ordinary hygienic measures. The wound is kept covered with a sterile dressing for the first 24 hours after surgery, by which time the incision has sealed. After the dressing is removed, the incision should be cleaned daily with mild soap and water and kept dry.

Negative pres-sure wound therapy is useful between debridement and defini-tive reconstruction to control the wound drainage and prevent bacterial contamination. When there is segmental bone loss, it is advisable to achieve soft tissue closure prior to performing osse-ous reconstruction. Preparation for later restoration of the bone requires steps to prevent the soft tissue from collapsing into the space where bone is needed. A common technique for this is to fill the space with antibiotic-impregnated beads or an antibiotic spacer at the time of soft tissue restoration until definitive bony reconstruction is possible. An external fixation may be needed, if there is segmental bone loss (Fig. 45-57A,B).The sequence for reconstruction is", "debridement of the wound edges as necessary. Wound care, consisting of debridement and dressing changes two to three times daily with mesh gauze, will promote growth of granulation tissue, with gradual filling in of the wound defect by secondary intention. Clean, granulating wounds can often be secondarily closed with good success, shortening the time required for complete wound healing. The technique of delayed primary wound closure can be used in contaminated surgical cases to lower the incidence of wound infection.

Many metabolic functions of the body are exquisitely sensitive to pH. Thus the pH of body fluids must be maintained within narrow limits. Normal pH is maintained by buffers within body fluids and by the coordinated action of the lungs, liver, and kidneys. The kidneys excrete a number of the end products of metabolism.

This is particularly true for moderate-and low-penetrance gene mutations. Therefore, predictive genetic testing should be approached with caution and only offered to patients who have been adequately counseled and have provided informed consent.

Mass screening programs require tests of high sensitivity and specificity to be cost-effective. Prerequisites for the success of genetic screening programs include the following: that the disorder is potentially serious; that it can be influenced at a presymptomatic stage by changes in behavior, diet, and/or pharmaceutical manipulations; and that the screening does not result in any harm or discrimination.

Individuals who test negative for a mutation in a disease-associated gene identified in an affected family member must be reminded that they may still be at risk for the disease.

Increased glucose transport: The transient increase in plasma glucose and insulin after a carbohydrate-rich meal leads to an increase in glucose transport into muscle cells (myocytes) by GLUT-4 (see p. 97 and Fig. 24.7, ), thereby reducing blood glucose.

In contrast, gluconeogenesis (see p. 117) can provide sustained synthesis of glucose, but it is somewhat slow in responding to a falling blood glucose level. Therefore, the body has developed mechanisms for storing a supply of glucose in a rapidly mobilized form, namely, glycogen. In the absence of a dietary source of glucose, this sugar is rapidly released into the blood from liver glycogen. Similarly, muscle glycogen is extensively degraded in exercising muscle to provide that tissue with an important energy source. When glycogen stores are depleted, specific tissues synthesize glucose de novo,", "liver smooths out potentially broad fluctuations in the availability of nutrients for the peripheral tissues. A. Carbohydrate metabolism The liver is normally a glucose-producing rather than a glucose-using organ. However, after a meal containing carbohydrate, the liver becomes a net consumer, retaining roughly 60 g of every 100 g of glucose presented by the portal system. This increased use reflects increased glucose uptake by the hepatocytes. Their insulin-independent glucose transporter (GLUT 2) has a low affinity (high Km [Michaelis constant]) for glucose and, therefore, takes up glucose only when blood glucose is high (see p. 98). Processes that are upregulated when hepatic glucose is increased include the following. 1. Increased glucose phosphorylation: The elevated levels of glucose within the hepatocyte (as a result of elevated extracellular levels) allow", "up to 55,000 glucosyl residues. These polymers of glucose exist as large, spherical, cytoplasmic granules (particles) that also contain most of the enzymes necessary for glycogen synthesis and degradation. C. Glycogen store fluctuation Liver glycogen stores increase during the well-fed state (see p. 323) and are depleted during a fast (see p. 329). Muscle glycogen is not affected by short periods of fasting (a few days) and is only moderately decreased in prolonged fasting (weeks). Muscle glycogen is synthesized to replenish muscle stores after they have been depleted following strenuous exercise. [Note: Glycogen synthesis and degradation go on continuously.

B. Fat metabolism FA are released from chylomicrons and VLDL by the action of LPL (see pp. 228 and 231). However, FA are of secondary importance as a fuel for resting muscle during the well-fed state, in which glucose is the primary source of energy. C. Amino acid metabolism 1.

In liver and muscle, insulin increases glycogen synthesis. In muscle and adipose, insulin increases glucose uptake by increasing the number of glucose transporters (GLUT-4; see p. 97) in the cell membrane. Thus, the IV administration of insulin causes an immediate decrease in blood glucose level. In the liver, insulin decreases the production of glucose through the inhibition of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. [Note: The effects of insulin are due not just to changes in enzyme activity but also in enzyme amount insofar as insulin alters gene transcription.] 2. Effects on lipid metabolism: A rise in insulin rapidly causes a significant reduction in the release of FA", "from the arterial circulation. As the arterial plasma glucose concentration falls below the physiologic range, blood-tobrain glucose transport becomes insufficient to support brain energy metabolism and function.

Diabetes Mellitus: Diagnosis, Classification, and Pathophysiology Glucose homeostasis reflects a balance between hepatic glucose production and peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Insulin is the most important regulator of this metabolic equilibrium, but neural input, metabolic signals, and other hormones (e.g., glucagon) result in integrated control of glucose supply and utilization (Fig. 417-4). The organs that regulate glucose and lipids communicate by neural and humoral mechanisms with fat and muscle producing adipokines, myokines, and metabolites that influence liver function.

The greater glycogen stores within the muscle are not read-ily available for systemic use due to a deficiency in glucose-6-phosphatase but are available for the energy needs of muscle cells. Therefore, in the fasting state, hepatic glycogen stores are rapidly and preferentially depleted, which results in a fall of serum glucose concentration within hours (<16 hours).During fasting, a healthy 70-kg adult will utilize 180 g of glucose per day to support the metabolism of obligate glycolytic cells such as neurons, leukocytes, erythrocytes, and the renal medullae.

Finally, the best-interests criterion holds that proxies should evaluate treatments by balancing their benefits and risks and select those treatments in which the benefits maximally outweigh the burdens of treatment. Clinicians have a clear and crucial role in this by carefully and dispassionately explaining the known benefits and burdens of specific treatments. Yet even when that information is as clear as possible, different individuals can have very different views of what is in the patient\u2019s best interests, and families may have disagreements or even overt conflicts. This criterion has been criticized because there is no single way to determine the balance between benefits and burdens; it depends on a patient\u2019s personal values.

Asthma is commonly exacerbated by specific triggers, although this can also be true of COPD. Many patients with lung disease report dyspnea on exertion. Determining the degree of activity that results in shortness of breath gives the clinician a gauge of the patient\u2019s degree of disability. Many patients adapt their level of activity to accommodate progressive limitation. For this reason, it is important, particularly in older patients, to delineate the activities in which they engage and how these activities have changed over time. Dyspnea on exertion is often an early symptom of underlying lung or heart disease and warrants a thorough evaluation. Cough generally indicates disease", "is directly proportional to the square of the velocity of expiratory airflow. A deep breath preceding a cough optimizes the function of the expiratory muscles; a series of repetitive coughs at successively lower lung volumes sweeps the point of maximal expiratory velocity progressively further into the lung periphery. Weak or ineffective cough compromises the ability to clear lower respiratory tract infections, predisposing to more serious infections and their sequelae. Weakness, paralysis, or pain of the expiratory (abdominal and intercostal) muscles is foremost on the list of causes of impaired cough (Table 48-1). Cough strength is generally assessed qualitatively; peak expiratory flow or maximal expiratory pressure at the mouth can be used as a surrogate marker for cough strength. A variety of assistive devices and techniques have been developed", "before starting the history, that the patient\u2019s complaints were not serious. Therefore, he felt confident that he could perform an abbreviated and focused examination by using the URI assessment protocol rather than considering the broader range of possibilities and performing appropriate tests to confirm or refute his initial hypotheses. In particular, by concentrating on the URI, the clinician failed to elicit the full dyspnea history, which would have suggested a far more serious disorder, and he neglected to search for other symptoms that could have directed him to the correct diagnosis. Heuristics, also referred to as cognitive shortcuts or rules of thumb, are simplifying decision strategies that ignore part of the data available so as to provide an efficient path to the desired judgment.

If on the second attempt the needle still hits bone (indicating lack of success in introducing it between the spinous processes), then the needle should be completely withdrawn and the patient should be repositioned. The second attempt is sometimes more successful if the patient straightens the spine completely prior to repositioning. The needle can then be reinserted at the same level or at an adjacent one. Once the SAS is reached, a manometer is attached to the needle and the opening pressure measured. The examiner should look for normal oscillations in CSF pressure associated with pulse and respirations. The upper limit of normal opening pressure with the patient supine is 180 mmH2O in adults but may be as high as 200\u2013250 mmH2O in", "such as bronchoscopy. This stepwise approach is discussed in detail below. HISTORY Dyspnea and Cough The cardinal symptoms of respiratory disease are dyspnea and cough (Chaps. 47e and 48). Dyspnea has many causes, some of which are not predominantly due to lung pathology. The words a patient uses to describe shortness of breath can suggest certain etiologies for dyspnea. Patients with obstructive lung disease often complain of \u201cchest tightness\u201d or \u201cinability to get a deep breath,\u201d whereas patients with congestive heart failure more commonly report \u201cair hunger\u201d or a sense of suffocation. The tempo of onset and the duration of a patient\u2019s dyspnea are likewise helpful in determining the etiology. Acute shortness of breath is usually associated with sudden physiologic changes, such as laryngeal edema, bronchospasm, myocardial infarction,", "at home. An alternative approach is to gain a sense of the patient\u2019s disability by inquiring about what activities are possible. These methods indirectly assess dyspnea and may be affected by nonrespiratory factors, such as leg arthritis or weakness. The Baseline Dyspnea Index and the Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire are commonly used tools for this purpose. Affective Dimension For a sensation to be reported as a symptom, it must be perceived as unpleasant and interpreted as abnormal. Laboratory studies have demonstrated that air hunger evokes a stronger affective response than does increased effort or work of breathing. Some therapies for dyspnea, such as pulmonary rehabilitation, may reduce breathing discomfort, in part, by altering this dimension. Dyspnea most often results from deviations from normal function in the cardiovascular and"]}, {"id": "seed_task_9999", "name": "MMLU_test_clinicalknowledge", "is_classification": true, "instruction": "In this task, you are given a question and four different answer options.

The current epidemic proportions of childhood obesity calls for a fresh and careful look at pediatric drug dosages. Studies in adults indicate that dosing based on per-kilogram body weight may constitute overdosing, because in obese subjects, drugs are distributed based on lean body weight.

Some patients become less responsive to levodopa, perhaps because of loss of dopaminergic nigrostriatal nerve terminals or some pathologic process directly involving striatal dopamine receptors.

Treatment with postsynaptic dopamine receptor blockers such as phenothiazines and butyrophenones may also be helpful. Haloperidol is started in a small dose, eg, 1 mg twice daily, and increased every 4 days depending on the response. If haloperidol is not helpful, treatment with increasing doses of fluphenazine in a similar dose, eg, 1 mg twice daily, sometimes helps.

It is generally preferable to keep treatment with this agent at a low level (eg, carbidopa-levodopa 25/100 three times daily) when possible, and if necessary, to add a dopamine agonist, to reduce the risk of development of response fluctuations. A controlled-release formulation of carbidopalevodopa is available and may be helpful in patients with established response fluctuations or as a means of reducing dosing frequency.

When the energy demands of an exercising muscle cannot be met by oxidative metabolism, an oxygen debt is incurred. Increased breathing during the recovery period after exercise reflects this oxygen debt.

Thus the endothelium plays an important role in regulating blood flow to specific vascular beds. The metabolic activity of a tissue governs blood flow in that tissue. Any intervention that results in inadequate O2 supply prompts the formation of vasodilator metabolites that are released from the tissue and act locally to dilate the resistance vessels. When the metabolic rate of the tissue increases, or when O2 delivery to the tissue decreases, more vasodilator substances are released (see Chapter 17). Potassium, inorganic phosphate ions, and interstitial fluid osmolarity induce vasodilation. During skeletal muscle contraction, both (1) K+ and phosphate are released and (2) osmolarity is increased.

Finally, the central nervous system contributes to fatigue, especially in how fatigue is perceived by the individual. Regardless of whether the muscle is fatigued as a consequence of high-intensity exercise or prolonged exercise, the myoplasmic ATP level does not decrease substantially.

This decay represents the rapid and almost total failure of the fast motor units. The decline in force/stress is paralleled by depletion of glycogen and creatine phosphate stores and the accumulation of lactic acid. Of importance is that the decline in force/ stress occurs when the ATP pool is not greatly reduced, so that the muscle fibers do not go into rigor. In contrast, the slow motor units are able to meet the energy demands of fibers under this condition, and they do not exhibit significant fatigue, even after many hours.

However, release of K+ is not sustained, but arteriolar dilation persists throughout the period of enhanced muscle activity. Furthermore, reoxygenated venous blood obtained from active cardiac and skeletal muscles does not elicit vasodilation when the blood is infused into a test vascular bed. It is unlikely that oxygenation of venous blood alters its K+ or phosphate content or its osmolarity and thereby neutralizes its vasodilator effect. Therefore, some agent other than K+ must mediate the vasodilation associated with metabolic activity of the tissue.

In view of the reliance of all cells on the availability of ATP to maintain viability, fatigue has been described as a protective mechanism to minimize the risk of muscle cell injury or death. Consequently, it is likely that skeletal muscle cells have developed redundant systems to ensure that ATP levels do not drop to dangerously low levels and hence risk the viability of the cell. Most persons tire and cease exercise long before the motor unit fatigues. General physical fatigue may be defined as a homeostatic disturbance produced by work. The basis for the perceived discomfort (or even pain) probably involves many factors. These factors may include a decrease in plasma glucose levels", "most representative can be presented in a textbook of neurology. The Nature of Primary Metabolic Myopathies The chemical energy for muscle contraction is provided by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP); ATP is restored by phosphocreatine and ADP acting in combination. These reactions are particularly important during brief, high-intensity exercise. During periods of prolonged muscle activity, rephosphorylation requires the availability of carbohydrates, fatty acids, and ketones, which are catabolized in mitochondria. Glycogen is the main sarcoplasmic source of carbohydrate, but blood glucose also moves freely in and out of muscle cells as needed during sustained exercise. The fatty acids in the blood, derived mainly from adipose tissue and intracellular lipid stores, constitute the other major source of energy. Carbohydrate is metabolized during aerobic and", "answer. 0.1. Which one of the following statements concerning gluconeogenesis is correct? A. It is an energy-producing (exergonic) process. B. It is important in maintaining blood glucose during a 2-day fast. C. It is inhibited by a fall in the insulin/glucagon ratio. D. It occurs in the cytosol of muscle cells. E. It uses carbon skeletons provided by fatty acid degradation. Correct answer = B. During a 2-day fast, glycogen stores are depleted, and gluconeogenesis maintains blood glucose. This is an energy-requiring (endergonic) pathway (both ATP and GTP get hydrolyzed) that occurs primarily in the liver, with the kidneys becoming major glucose producers in prolonged fasting. Gluconeogenesis uses both mitochondrial and cytosolic enzymes and is stimulated by a fall in the insulin/glucagon ratio. Fatty acid degradation yields acetyl", "is present in the myoplasm, a small amount is located in the thick filament (near the M line). The creatine phosphokinase in the thick filament may participate in the rapid resynthesis of ATP near the myosin heads during muscle contraction. The phosphate store created, however, is only about five times the size of the ATP store and thus cannot support prolonged periods of contraction (less than a minute of maximal muscle activity). Skeletal muscle fatigue during intense exercise is associated with depletion of the creatine phosphate store, although as described subsequently, this does not necessarily imply that the fatigue is caused by depletion of the creatine phosphate store. Because the creatine phosphokinase\u2013catalyzed reaction is reversible, the muscle cell replenishes the creatine phosphate pool during recovery from fatigue by", "\u201361.9 kJ (see Panel 2\u20138, pp. 104\u2013105) for example, 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate \u201349.0 kJ (see Panel 2\u20138) \u201340 creatine phosphate (activated carrier that \u201343.0 kJ stores energy in muscle) for example, ATP when hydrolyzed \u201330.6 kJ to ADP \u201320 for example, glucose 6-phosphate \u201317.5 kJ (see Panel 2\u20138) specifc examples showing the standard free-energy change (\u02dcG\u00b0) for hydrolysis of phosphate bond Figure 2\u201350 Phosphate bonds have different energies. examples of different types of phosphate bonds with their sites of hydrolysis are shown in the molecules depicted on the left.

This decay represents the rapid and almost total failure of the fast motor units. The decline in force/stress is paralleled by depletion of glycogen and creatine phosphate stores and the accumulation of lactic acid. Of importance is that the decline in force/ stress occurs when the ATP pool is not greatly reduced, so that the muscle fibers do not go into rigor. In contrast, the slow motor units are able to meet the energy demands of fibers under this condition, and they do not exhibit significant fatigue, even after many hours.

Most patients can be helped to understand this concept and utilize it in the rational programming of activity.

Currently, widespread community screening for and treatment of H. pylori as primary prophylaxis for gastric cancer and peptic ulcers are not recommended in most countries, mainly because the extent of the consequent reduction in cancer risk is not known.

Treatment The mainstay in the treatment of voiding difficulty is clean, intermittent self-catheterization (145). The most important protection against urinary tract infection is frequent and complete bladder emptying rather than avoiding the introduction of a foreign body into the bladder. Selfcatheterization allows the patient to accomplish this task using a small (14-Fr) plastic catheter that she inserts through the urethra into the bladder, draining its contents. The catheter is then removed, washed with soap and water, dried, and stored in a clean, dry place. Elaborate sterile procedures are not necessary. Bacteria are introduced into the bladder in this process, and the urine of women after self-catheterization regimens will always be colonized with bacteria; however, this condition should not be treated unless", "than after 14 days. In general, a 7to 14-day course of antibiotics is recommended, but further studies on the optimal duration of therapy are needed. In the setting of long-term catheter use, systemic antibiotics, bladder-acidifying agents, antimicrobial bladder washes, topical disinfectants, and antimicrobial drainage-bag solutions have all been ineffective at preventing the onset of bacteriuria and have been associated with the emergence of resistant organisms. The best strategy for prevention of CAUTI is to avoid insertion of unnecessary catheters and to remove catheters once they are no longer necessary. Evidence is insufficient to recommend suprapubic catheters and condom catheters as alternatives to indwelling urinary catheters as a means to prevent CAUTI. However, intermittent catheterization may be preferable to long-term indwelling urethral catheterization in certain populations (e.g., spinal cord\u2013injured", "outside of the catheter. Indwelling catheters facilitate direct access to the bladder and should have a closed drainage system. After simple, straight catheterization, the incidence of UTI is 1% to 2%. Organisms that cause catheter-associated UTIs include fecal flora, such as gram-negative enteric bacilli, most commonly Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus. With concomitant antibiotic treatment, resistant organisms predominate, and fungi emerge as pathogens. The most important aspect of prevention is to minimize the duration and use of catheterization. Intermittent catheterization is preferred over indwelling catheter drainage whenever feasible. Insertion of catheters must be performed with aseptic technique, and the drainage system must remain closed at all times, with sterile technique used whenever the system is entered.

(A detailed account of cystometric techniques can be found in the monograph of Krane and Siroky.) A simple way of determining bladder atony (prostatic obstruction and overdistention having been excluded) is to measure the residual urine (by catheterization of the bladder) immediately after voluntary voiding or to estimate its volume by ultrasound imaging.

The consideration of lyonization must begin with Mary Lyon, who in 1962 proposed that in females, only one X chromosome is genetically active. X inactivation occurs early in fetal life, about 16 days after conception. Either the paternal or the maternal X chromosome is randomly inactivated in each cell of the developing embryo. Once inactivated, the same X chromosome remains inactive in all of the progeny of these cells. Moreover, all but one X chromosome is inactivated, and so a 48,XXXX female has only one active X chromosome. This phenomenon explains why normal females do not have a double dose (compared with males) of phenotypic attributes encoded on the X chromosome. The Lyon hypothesis also explains", "or mendelian disorder is caused by a mutation or alteration in a single locus or gene in one or both members of a gene pair. Types of mendelian inheritance include autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked, and Y-linked. Other monogenic inheritance patterns, described subsequently, include mitochondrial inheritance, uniparental disomy, imprinting, and trinucleotide repeat expansion-also termed anticipation. By age 25, approximately 0.4 percent of the population exhibits an abnormality attributed to a monogenic disorder, and 2 percent will have at least one such disorder during their lifetime (Table 13-3).

The cause of the toppling phenomenon is unclear; it does not have its basis in weakness, ataxia, or loss of deep sensation.

Although hepatic glycogen stores are usually sufficient to maintain plasma glucose levels for \u223c8 h, this period can be shorter if glucose demand is increased by exercise or if glycogen stores are depleted by illness or starvation. Gluconeogenesis normally requires low insulin levels and the presence of anti-insulin (counterregulatory) hormones together with a coordinated supply of precursors from muscle and adipose tissue to the liver (and kidneys). Muscle provides lactate, pyruvate, alanine, glutamine, and other amino acids. Triglycerides in adipose tissue are broken down into fatty acids and glycerol, which is a gluconeogenic precursor. Fatty acids provide an alternative oxidative fuel to tissues other than the brain (which requires glucose). Systemic glucose balance\u2014maintenance of the normal plasma glucose", "precursors are molecules that can be used to produce a net synthesis of glucose. The most important gluconeogenic precursors are glycerol, lactate, and \u03b1-keto acids obtained from the metabolism of glucogenic amino acids. [Note: All but two amino acids (leucine and lysine) are glucogenic (see p. 262).] A. Glycerol Glycerol is released during the hydrolysis of triacylglycerols (TAG) in adipose tissue (see p. 190) and is delivered by the blood to the liver. Glycerol is phosphorylated by glycerol kinase to glycerol 3-phosphate, B.

In the Cori cycle, this lactate is taken up by the liver and oxidized to pyruvate that is converted to glucose, which", "degradation of TAG, glycogen, and protein. This sets into motion an exchange of substrates among the liver, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and brain that is guided by two priorities: 1) the need to maintain adequate plasma levels of glucose to sustain energy metabolism in the brain, red blood cells, and other glucose-requiring tissues and 2) the need to mobilize FA from TAG in WAT for the synthesis and release of ketone bodies by the liver to supply energy to other tissues and spare body protein. As a result, blood glucose levels are maintained within a narrow range in fasting, while FA and ketone body levels increase. [Note: Maintaining glucose requires that the substrates for gluconeogenesis (such as pyruvate, alanine, and glycerol) be available.] A. Fuel stores The metabolic", "from liver glycogen. Similarly, muscle glycogen is extensively degraded in exercising muscle to provide that tissue with an important energy source. When glycogen stores are depleted, specific tissues synthesize glucose de novo, using glycerol, lactate, pyruvate, and amino acids as carbon sources for gluconeogenesis (see Chapter 10). Figure 11.1 shows the reactions of glycogen synthesis and degradation as part of the essential pathways of energy metabolism. II. STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION The main stores of glycogen are found in skeletal muscle and liver, although most other cells store small amounts of glycogen for their own use. The function of muscle glycogen is to serve as a fuel reserve for the synthesis of ATP during muscle contraction. That of liver glycogen is to maintain the blood glucose concentration, particularly during", "during the interdigestive and fasting phases as opposed to \u201con a full stomach\u201d), although much of this lactate is utilized by aerobic skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle during exercise. But additionally the overall anabolism of the digestive phase switches over to a general catabolism during the fasting phase (see Fig. 39.3B ). TGs within adipocytes undergo lipolysis to FFAs and glycerol, and there is a general net proteolysis with the release of AAs during the fasting state. The glycerol and gluconeogenic AAs are released from cells and circulate to the liver, where they are subsequently used for gluconeogenesis. Thus gluconeogenesis requires an integration of catabolic pathways in adipocytes and skeletal myocytes with anabolic gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes. Gluconeogenesis eventually supplants glycogenolysis and can continue as long as precursors flow", "by hepatic gluconeogenesis from glucogenic precursors, such as amino acids from proteolysis and glycerol from lipolysis. In prolonged fasting (beyond 2\u20133 weeks), plasma ketone bodies (see Fig. 24.12) reach significantly elevated levels and replace glucose as the primary fuel for the brain (see Figs. 24.16, and 24.17). This reduces the need for protein catabolism for gluconeogenesis: Ketone bodies spare glucose and, thus, muscle protein. [Note: As the duration of a fast extends from overnight to days to weeks, blood glucose levels initially drop and then are maintained at the lower level (65\u201370 mg/dl).] The metabolic changes that occur during fasting insure that all tissues have an adequate supply of fuel molecules. The response of the major tissues involved in energy metabolism during fasting is summarized in Figure 24.18.", "glucose sparing depends on catabolic adipocyte metabolism, which results in lipolysis of stored TGs and release of FFAs. FFAs are imported by hepatocytes, which use FFAs to produce acetyl CoA. Protein degradation in available for ketogenesis. High levels of intramitochondrial acetyl CoA in the hepatocyte not only provides ample carbons for ATP synthesis but serves to: (1) inhibit conver sion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, (2) promote conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate for gluconeogenesis, and (3) promote synthesis of KBs (see Fig. 39.3B ). After several days of fasting, the CNS can start using KBs for energy, thereby further sparing glucose for erythrocytes. Many other cell types with mitochondria use KBs along with FFAs for ATP production, especially skeletal muscle. The hormones that drive glycogenolysis, gluconeogen esis, lipogenesis,", "produced by the catabolism of BCAA (see p. 267). The glutamine is used as a fuel by enterocytes, for example, which send out alanine that is used in hepatic gluconeogenesis (glucose\u2013alanine cycle)]. In the second week of fasting, the rate of muscle proteolysis decreases, paralleling a decline in the need for glucose as a fuel for the brain, which has begun using ketone bodies as a source of energy. XI. BRAIN IN FASTING During the early days of fasting, the brain continues to use only glucose as a fuel (Fig. 24.16, ). Blood glucose is maintained by hepatic gluconeogenesis from glucogenic precursors, such as amino acids from proteolysis and glycerol from lipolysis. In prolonged fasting (beyond 2\u20133 weeks), plasma ketone bodies (see Fig. 24.12) reach significantly elevated levels", "for gluconeogenesis. Thus gluconeogenesis requires an integration of catabolic pathways in adipocytes and skeletal myocytes with anabolic gluconeogenesis in hepatocytes. Gluconeogenesis eventually supplants glycogenolysis and can continue as long as precursors flow into the liver. Glucose sparing represents the other general process that contributes to maintenance of adequate circulating glucose levels during the fasting phase. Glucose sparing means the switching of fuel utilization from glucose to a nongluconeogenic fuel in most cell types, but especially in skeletal muscle, which represents the potentially largest single consumer of glucose. First, the uptake of glucose by skeletal muscle and adipocytes is greatly reduced because the GLUT4 transporter isoform exists in an intracellular CHAPTER 39 Hormonal Regulation of Energy Metabolism Fig. 39.3B) during the fasting phase.

Glucose is the only fuel that can be utilized by hypoxemic tissues (anaerobic glycolysis), white blood cells, and newly generated fibroblasts. Infusions of glucose partially offset a negative energy balance but do not significantly suppress the high rates of gluconeogenesis in catabolic patients.

Unfortunately, this approach is neither accurate nor reliable. Other methods, however, can be used to reliably detect the reappearance of a pulse distal to the cuff and thereby estimate systolic blood pressure. Two excellent and widely available approaches for pulse detection are use of a Doppler stethoscope (reappearance of the pulse produces an audible amplified signal) or a pulse oximeter (reappearance of the pulse is indicated by flashing of a light-emitting diode).A number of automated devices are capable of repeti-tively measuring blood pressure noninvasively.

However, the level of cuff pressure at the time of muffling of the Korotkoff sounds (phase IV) generally corresponds fairly closely to the true intraarterial diastolic pressure. As the disease progresses and the LV end-diastolic pressure rises, the arterial diastolic pressure may actually rise as well, because the aortic diastolic pressure cannot fall below the LV end-diastolic pressure. For the same reason, acute severe AR may also be accompanied by only a slight widening of the pulse pressure.

Blood pressure is best assessed at the brachial artery level, though it can be measured at the radial, popliteal, or pedal pulse level.

Or, there is respiratory alternans, a pattern of diaphragmatic descent only on alternate breaths (this is more characteristic of airway obstruction).

CHAPTER SUMMARY The flow of intermediates through metabolic pathways is controlled by four regulatory mechanisms: 1) the availability of substrates, 2) allosteric activation and inhibition of enzymes, 3) covalent modification of enzymes, and 4) induction-repression of enzyme synthesis. In the absorptive state, the 2-to 4-hour period after ingestion of a meal, these mechanisms insure that available nutrients are captured as glycogen, triacylglycerol (TAG), and protein (Fig. 24.20). During this interval, transient increases in plasma glucose, amino acids, and TAG occur, the last primarily as components of chylomicrons synthesized by the intestinal mucosal cells. The pancreas responds to the elevated levels", "This important reaction takes place in the mammalian mitochondrion, as part of the pathway that oxidizes sugars to CO2 and H2O (see page 82).

Although the liver contributes in a pivotal way to the maintenance of whole-body biochemical status, a complete discussion of all the underpinning reactions is beyond the scope of this chapter. We will confine our discussion primarily to hepatic functions that relate to gastrointestinal physiology. Metabolic Functions of the Liver Hepatocytes contribute to metabolism of the major nutrients: carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. Thus the liver plays an important role in glucose metabolism by engaging in gluconeogenesis, conversion of other sugars to glucose. The liver also stores glucose as glycogen at times of glucose excess (e.g., postprandial period) and then releases stored glucose into the bloodstream as it is needed. This process is referred to as the glucose buffer function of the liver. When hepatic", "processes required in different tissues are not the same. For example, nerve cells, which are probably the most fastidious cells in the body, maintain almost no reserves of glycogen or fatty acids and rely almost entirely on a constant Figure 2\u201362 The nine essential amino acids. These cannot be synthesized by human cells and so must be supplied in the diet. Figure 2\u201363 Glycolysis and the citric acid cycle are at the center of an elaborate set of metabolic pathways in human cells. some 2000 metabolic reactions are shown schematically with the reactions of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle in red. many other reactions either lead into these two central pathways\u2014delivering small molecules to be catabolized with production of energy\u2014or they lead outward and thereby supply carbon", "Glucokinase differs from hexokinases I\u2013III in several important properties. For example, it has a much higher Km, requiring a higher glucose concentration for half-saturation (see Fig. 8.13). Thus, glucokinase functions only when the intracellular concentration of glucose in the hepatocyte is elevated such as during the brief period following consumption of a carbohydrate-rich meal, when high levels of glucose are delivered to the liver via the portal vein. Glucokinase has a high Vmax, allowing the liver to effectively remove the flood of glucose delivered by the portal blood. This prevents large amounts of glucose from entering the systemic circulation following such a meal, thereby minimizing hyperglycemia during the absorptive period. [Note: GLUT-2 insures that blood glucose equilibrates rapidly across the hepatocyte membrane.] b. Regulation: Glucokinase activity is not", "but ignores its mirror image, L-glucose. Suppose that you were able to synthesize hexokinase entirely from D-amino acids, which are the mirror image of the normal L-amino acids. a.

In animal cells, by contrast, most inward transport across the plasma membrane is driven by the Na+ gradient (high Na+ outside, low Na+ inside) that is established by the Na+-K+ pump (see Figure 11\u201315). Some unusual bacteria have adapted to live in a very alkaline environment and yet must maintain their cytoplasm at a physiological pH. For these cells, any attempt to generate an electrochemical H+ gradient would be opposed by a large H+ concentration gradient in the wrong direction (H+ higher inside than outside)."]}, {"id": "seed_task_9999", "name": "MMLU_test_clinicalknowledge", "is_classification": true, "instruction": "In this task, you are given a question and four different answer options.

To assess severity and provide quantitative baseline measures, pain and urgency should be estimated by the patient on a scale of 0\u201310, with 0 being none and 10 the worst 60e-3 imaginable. Frequency per 24-h period should be determined and nocturia assessed as the number of times per night the", "2 L/d. Because of differences in insensible fluid losses and fluid intake from food sources, the required total fluid intake will vary from person to person. Rather than specify how much to drink, it is more helpful to educate patients about how much more they need to drink in light of their 24-h urine volume. For example, if the daily urine volume is 1.5 L, then the patient should be advised to drink at least 0.5 L more per day in order to increase the urine volume to the goal of 2 L/day.

If a urinary tract infection is documented by microscopy or culture, it is reasonable to see whether urinary tract symptoms improved with eradication of bacteriuria. Occasionally, a simple urinary tract infection causes the onset or exacerbation of urinary incontinence. Some women, particularly older ones, have asymptomatic bacteriuria that truly is asymptomatic; thus, if attempted treatment of a woman with bacteriuria but without classic urinary tract infection symptoms (such as dysuria, urgency, or frequency) does not improve incontinence, further antibacterial treatment is generally unnecessary. If hematuria and bacteriuria are found, the urine should be rechecked after eradication of the bacteriuria.

Frequency per 24-h period should be determined and nocturia assessed as the number of times per night the patient is awakened by the need to urinate. About half of patients with IC/BPS have intermittent or persistent microscopic hematuria; this manifestation and the need to exclude bladder stones or cancer require urologic or urogynecologic referral. Initiation of therapy for IC/BPS does not hamper subsequent urologic evaluation. The goal of therapy is to relieve the symptoms of IC/BPS; the challenge lies in the fact that no treatment is uniformly successful. However, most patients eventually obtain relief, generally with a multifaceted approach. The American Urological Association\u2019s guidelines for management of IC/BPS are an excellent resource.

A complete list of current prescription and over-the-counter medications as well as vitamin and mineral supplements is essential. The review of systems should focus on identifying possible etiologic factors related to low urine volume (e.g., high insensible losses; low fluid intake) and gastrointestinal malabsorption as well as on ascertaining how frequently the patient voids during the day and overnight.

The relationships among recurrent UTI, chronic pyelonephritis, and renal insufficiency have been widely studied. In the absence of anatomic abnormalities, recurrent infection in children and adults does not lead to chronic pyelonephritis or to renal failure. Moreover, infection does not play a primary role in chronic interstitial nephritis; the primary etiologic factors in this condition are analgesic abuse, obstruction, reflux, and toxin exposure.

FLUIDS AND BEVERAGES The risk of stone formation increases as urine volume decreases. When the urine output is less than 1 L/d, the risk of stone formation more than doubles. Fluid intake is the main determinant of urine volume, and the importance of fluid intake in preventing stone formation has been demonstrated in observational studies and in a randomized controlled trial. Observational studies have found that coffee, tea, beer, and wine are associated with a reduced risk of stone formation. Sugar-sweetened carbonated beverage consumption may 1867 increase risk.

The goal of an efficacious incision is to provide adequate exposure to perform the proce-dure with minimal perturbation of the abdominal wall function.Incisions for open abdominal surgery are generally located in proximity to operative targets. There are two general types of incisions: longitudinal or transverse/oblique (Fig. 35-4). There does not appear to be differences in early or late postoperative complications or recovery time between these two types of inci-sions. However, transverse incisions may be associated with lower incisional hernia rates but higher rates of wound infec-tions. Overall, without clear evidence of superiority the choice of incision remains a surgeon-dependent decision. Several retractor systems can be used to provide exposure using these open incisions. Examples", "the surgeon makes a small incision just below the umbilicus and under direct vision locates the abdominal fascia. Two Kocher clamps are placed on the fascia, and with curved Mayo scissors, a small incision is made through the fascia and underlying peritoneum. A fin-ger is placed into the abdomen to make sure that there is no adherent bowel. A sturdy suture is placed on each side of the fascia and secured to the wings of a specialized trocar, which is then passed directly into the abdominal cavity (Fig. 14-7). Rapid insufflation can make up for some of the time lost with the initial dissection. This technique is preferable for the abdo-men of patients who have undergone previous operations in which small bowel may be adherent to the undersurface", "preference. For diagnostic laparoscopy, the most useful and cosmetically acceptable site for insertion of an ancillary cannula is in the midline of the lower abdomen, about 2 to 4 cm above the symphysis. The ancillary cannula should not be inserted too close to the symphysis because it limits the mobility of the ancillary instruments and access to the cul-de-sac. Laparoscopic cannulas can become dislodged and slip out of the incision during a procedure. There are a variety of cannula designs designed to reduce slippage, which include those with threaded exteriors and anchoring systems with balloon tips. Lateral placement of lower-quadrant cannulas is useful for operative laparoscopy, but the superficial and inferior epigastric vessels must be located to avoid injury (Fig. 23.3).

For this, once the linea alba is reached, it is grasped with two Allis clamps-one placed on either side of the planned fascial incision. The purchase of tissue with each clamp should be substantial and creates a small roll of fascia to be incised. Often, the peritoneum is incorporated simultaneously and entered. If not, the peritoneum is grasped with two hemostats and sharply cut. Others may prefer to bluntly enter with a single index finger. Notably, if the initial fascial incision is too small, it can be extended with curved Mayo scissors. Adequate exposure is critical, and army-navy or appendiceal retractors are suitable. For obese women, a slightly larger incision and narrow deeper retractors may be required. If bowel", "to close the abdomen as quickly as possible. Multiple techniques have been introduced to obtain fascial closure of the open abdomen to minimize mor-bidity and cost of care. Historically, for patients who could not be closed at repeat operation, approximation of the fascia with mesh (prosthetic or biologic) was used, with planned reopera-tion. Another option was split-thickness skin grafts applied directly to the exposed bowel for coverage; removal of the skin Brunicardi_Ch07_p0183-p0250.indd 23910/12/18 6:21 PM 240BASIC CONSIDERATIONSPART Igrafts was planned 9 to 12 months after the initial surgery, with definitive repair of the hernia by component separation.

The versatility of the devices with energy makes them the method of choice to occlude vessels. There are no valid clinical data showing that one instrument is safer than another. The preferred one involves bipolar energy because gynecologists are experienced with this form of energy. Surgical Technique of Laparoscopic Hysterectomy Peritoneal Access The most important technical consideration for all laparoscopic surgery is port placement (see Chapter 23). The umbilical site typically is used in patients without a previous history of surgery or intra-abdominal infection. In cases of previous surgery where there was a midline incision or a history of a pelvic-abdominal incision, an open laparoscopy is recommended or an alternative site is chosen to introduce the primary cannula. The", "next step is placement of the mesh. Lightweight barbed mesh and anatomically preshaped mesh are routinely used. Mesh should be an appropriate size to cover the myopectineal orifice entirely, and the peritoneal dissection will need to be large enough to accommodate this size mesh. It is rolled and placed through one of the ports by the bedside assistant. Then it is unrolled and placed in the pelvis overlapping the pubic symphysis by several centimeters medially; this is essential as the majority of recur-rences occur in this area. Utilization of tacking devices are not necessary, which helps to reduce procedural cost; however, this is surgeon preference. Finally, the peritoneal flap is placed back over the mesh layer and sutured back into place with a running locking suture that is", "procedures to increase venous return and provides inhibition of thrombo-plastin activation.General Principles of AccessThe most natural ports of access for MIS and NOTES are the anatomic portals of entry and exit. The nares, mouth, anus, vagina, and urethra are used to access the respiratory, GI, and urinary systems. The advantage of using these points of access is that no incision is required. The disadvantages lie in the long distances between the orifice and the region of interest. For NOTES procedures, the vagina may serve as point of access, entering the abdomen via the posterior cul-de-sac of the pelvis. Similarly, the peritoneal cavity may be reached through the side wall of the stomach or colon.Access to the vascular system may be accomplished under local anesthesia by cutting down and"]}, {"id": "seed_task_9999", "name": "MMLU_test_clinicalknowledge", "is_classification": true, "instruction": "In this task, you are given a question and four different answer options.

Obstructed labor can occur in rural areas where girls are married young (sometimes as early as 9 to 10 years of age) and where transportation is poor and access to medical services is limited. In such circumstances, pregnancy often occurs shortly after menstruation begins and before maternal skeletal growth is complete. When labor begins, cephalopelvic disproportion is common and little can be done to correct fetal malpresentations.

Selection of the route of hysterectomy must be done considering the anatomy, the disorder or disease state, the patient\u2019s wishes, and the training and experience of the surgeon. Laparoscopic hysterectomy offers no advantage for women in whom vaginal hysterectomy is possible because the endoscopic approach is more expensive and probably has a higher risk for perioperative morbidity (51). The ideal place for laparoscopic hysterectomy is as a replacement for abdominal hysterectomy.

Various techniques of endometrial ablation were compared with the gold standard of endometrial resection, and the evidence suggests comparable success rates and complication profiles (190). The advantages of techniques other than hysterectomy include a shorter recovery time and less early morbidity.

Most current methods of manipulating DNA, RNA, and proteins rely on prior knowledge of the nucleotide sequence of the genome of interest. But how were these sequences determined in the first place? And how are new DNA and RNA molecules sequenced today? In the late 1970s, researchers developed several strategies for determining, simply and quickly, the nucleotide sequence of any purified DNA fragment. The one that became the most widely used is called dideoxy sequencing or Sanger sequencing (Panel 8\u20131). This method was used to determine the nucleotide sequence of many genomes, including those of E. coli, fruit flies, nematode worms, mice, and humans.

Sequencing cloned DNA fragments The base sequence of DNA fragments that have been cloned can be determined. The original procedure for this purpose was the Sanger dideoxy chain termination method illustrated in Figure 34.9. In this method, the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) to be sequenced is used as the template for DNA synthesis by DNA polymerase (DNA pol). A radiolabeled primer complementary to the 3\u2032-end of the target DNA is added, along with the four deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTP). The sample is divided into four reaction tubes, and a small amount of one of the four dideoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (ddNTP) is added to each tube. Because it contains no 3\u2032-hydroxyl group, incorporation of a ddNMP terminates elongation at that point. The products of", "The immobilized DNA strands are prevented from self-annealing but are available for hybridization to the exogenous, radiolabeled, single-stranded probe. The extent of hybridization is measured by the retention of radioactivity on the membrane. Excess probe molecules that do not hybridize are removed by washing the membrane. B. Synthetic oligonucleotide probes If the sequence of all or part of the target DNA is known, short, single-stranded oligonucleotide probes can be synthesized that are complementary to a small region of the gene of interest. If the sequence of the gene is unknown, the amino acid sequence of the protein, the final gene product, may be used to construct a nucleic acid probe using the genetic code as a guide.

Because cDNA has no introns, it can be cloned into an expression vector for the synthesis of human proteins by bacteria or eukaryotes. Cloned, then purified, fragments of DNA can be sequenced, for example, using the Sanger dideoxy chain termination method.

These and other experimental approaches have permitted the identification of both normal and mutant nucleotide sequences in DNA. This knowledge has led to the development of methods for the diagnosis of genetic diseases and some successes in the treatment of patients by gene therapy. [Note: The genomes of several viruses, prokaryotes, and nonhuman eukaryotes have also been sequenced.] II.

In comparison, a restriction nuclease with a target sequence that is eight nucleotides long would be expected to cleave DNA on average once every 65,536 nucleotide pairs (1 in 48).

Gel Electrophoresis Separates DNA Molecules of Different Sizes The same types of gel-electrophoresis methods that have proved so useful in the analysis of proteins (see Figure 8\u201313) can be applied to DNA molecules.

The nucleotide sequence of any genome can be determined rapidly and simply by using highly automated techniques based on several different strategies. Comparison of the genome sequences of different organisms allows us to trace the evolutionary relationships among genes and organisms, and it has proved valuable for discovering new genes and predicting their functions. Taken together, these techniques for analyzing and manipulating DNA have made it possible to sequence, identify, and isolate genes from any organism of interest.

In the living will, the patient indicates which treatments she wishes to permit or prohibit in the setting of terminal illness. The possible treatments addressed often include mechanical ventilation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, artificial nutri-tion, dialysis, antibiotics, or transfusion of blood products. Unfor-tunately, living wills are often too vague to offer concrete guidance in complex clinical situations, and the language (\u201ctermi-nal illness,\u201d \u201cartificial nutrition\u201d) can be interpreted in many ways. Furthermore, by limiting the directive only to \u201cterminal\u201d conditions, it does not provide guidance for common clinical sce-narios like advanced dementia, delirium, or persistent vegetative states where the patient is unable to make decisions, but is not \u201cterminally\u201d ill.

End-of-Life Decisions Unfortunately, a smooth transition in treatment goals from curative to palliative may not be possible in all cases because of the occurrence of serious treatment-related complications or rapid disease progression.

Severely ill patients may have septic shock and evidence of organ failure. When confronted with possible CAP, the physician must ask two questions: Is this pneumonia, and, if so, what is the likely etiology? The former question is typically answered by clinical and radiographic methods, whereas the latter requires the aid of laboratory techniques. Clinical Diagnosis The differential diagnosis includes both infectious and noninfectious entities such as acute bronchitis, acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis, heart failure, pulmonary embolism, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and radiation pneumonitis. The importance of a careful history cannot be overemphasized. For example, known cardiac disease may suggest worsening pulmonary edema, while underlying carcinoma may suggest lung injury secondary to irradiation.

Indeed, the use of invasive interventions such as mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy is commonplace in the intensive care unit (ICU). An appreciation of the risks and benefits of such aggressive and often invasive interventions is vital to ensure an optimal outcome. Nonetheless, intensivists must recognize when a patient\u2019s chances for recovery are remote or nonexistent and must counsel and comfort dying patients and their significant others. Critical care physicians often must redirect the goals of care from resuscitation and cure to comfort when the resolution of an underlying illness is not possible. ASSESSMENT OF ILLNESS", "criterion has been criticized because there is no single way to determine the balance between benefits and burdens; it depends on a patient\u2019s personal values. For instance, for some people, being alive even if mentally incapacitated is a benefit, whereas for others, it may be the worst possible existence. As a matter of practice, physicians rely on family members to make decisions that they feel are best and object only if those decisions seem to demand treatments that the physicians consider not beneficial. practIces Withholding and withdrawing acutely life-sustaining medical interventions from terminally ill patients are now standard practice. More than 90% of American patients die without cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and just as many forgo other potentially life-sustaining interventions. For instance, in ICUs in the period 1987\u20131988, CPR", "often experience respiratory distress due to pulmonary edema (e.g., in cardiogenic shock), lactic acidosis, and anemia. In this setting, up to 40% of cardiac output may be distributed to the respiratory muscles. Intubation and mechanical ventilation can allow redistribution of the cardiac output away from the respiratory muscles and back to vital organs while the shock is treated. (See also Chap. 323) Whereas a thorough understanding of the pathophysiology of respiratory failure is essential for optimal patient care, recognition of a patient\u2019s readiness to be liberated from mechanical ventilation is likewise important. Several studies have shown that daily spontaneous breathing trials can identify patients who are ready for extubation. Accordingly, all intubated, mechanically ventilated patients should undergo daily screening of respiratory function. If oxygenation is stable (i.e., PaO2/FIO2", "Society of Critical Care Medicine (1988, 1999) subsequently established guidelines for ICUs. Especially pertinent to obstetrics, these costly units prompted the evolution of a step-down intermediate care unit. hese latter units were designed for patients who did not require intensive care, but who needed a higher level of care than that provided on a general ward. The American College of Critical Care Medicine and the Society of Critical Care Medicine (1998) have published guidelines for these units (Table TABLE 47-1 .

These reduced coenzymes can, in turn, each donate a pair of electrons to a specialized set of electron carriers, collectively called the electron transport chain (ETC), described in this section. As electrons are passed down the ETC, they lose much of their free energy. This energy is used to move H+ across the inner mitochondrial membrane, creating a H+ gradient that drives the production of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi), described on p. 77. The coupling of electron transport with ATP synthesis is called oxidative phosphorylation, sometimes denoted as OXPHOS. It proceeds continuously in all tissues that contain mitochondria.

These molecules can therefore be regarded as carriers of hydride ions (the H+ plus two electrons, or H\u2013).

Energy carried by ATP ATP consists of a molecule of adenosine (adenine + ribose) to which three phosphate groups are attached (Fig. 6.5).

Note that only the two polar regions of the intrafusal muscle contract; the equatorial region, where the nuclei are located, does not contract because it has little contractile protein. Nevertheless, when the polar regions contract, the equatorial region elongates and regains its sensitivity. Conversely, when a muscle relaxes (\u03b1 motor neuron activity drops) and thus elongates (if its ends are being pulled), a concurrent decrease in \u03b3 motor neuron activity allows the intrafusal fibers to relax (and thus elongate) as well and thereby prevent the tension on the central portion of the intrafusal fiber from reaching a level at which firing of the afferent fibers is saturated.

Immediately upon arrival of the signal, the muscle cell needs to be able to contract very rapidly, with all the sarcomeres shortening simultaneously. Two major features of the muscle cell make extremely rapid contraction possible. First, as previously discussed, the individual myosin motor heads in each thick filament spend only a small fraction of the ATP cycle time bound to the filament and actively generating force, so many myosin heads can act in rapid succession on the same thin filament without interfering with one another.

However, relaxed muscles in the body are comparatively firm. This firmness, or tone, is caused by low levels of contractile activity in some of the motor units and is driven by reflex arcs from the muscle spindles.

The tone in skeletal muscle is distinct from the \u201ctone\u201d in smooth muscle (see Muscle cells convert chemical energy to mechanical energy. ATP is the energy source used for this conversion.

This activator calcium brings about the tension-generating interaction of actin with myosin. Calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum via a calcium channel, called the ryanodine receptor (RyR) channel because the plant alkaloid ryanodine combines with a receptor on the channel protein. In the case of the skeletal muscle RyR1 channel, ryanodine facilitates the open configuration.

The simplest receptor is a bare axon called a nonencapsulated (free) nerve ending. This ending is found in epithelia, in connective tissue, and in close association with hair follicles. Most sensory nerve endings acquire connective tissue capsules or sheaths of varying complexity.", "form sensory ganglia. Generally, all sensory information passes into the posterior aspect of the spinal cord, and all motor fibers leave anteriorly. Somatic sensory neurons carry information from the periphery into the CNS and are also called somatic sensory afferents or general somatic afferents (GSAs). The modalities carried by these nerves include temperature, pain, touch, and proprioception. Proprioception is the sense of determining the position and movement of the musculoskeletal system detected by special receptors in muscles and tendons. Somatic motor fibers carry information away from the CNS to skeletal muscles and are also called somatic motor efferents or general somatic efferents (GSEs). Like somatic sensory fibers that come from the periphery, somatic motor fibers can be very long. They extend from cell bodies in the spinal cord", "on the large, heavily myelinated fibers that originate in muscle spindles. Conversely, in neuropathies that affect the largest diameter and most heavily myelinated fibers, the tendon reflexes are diminished early and disproportionately to weakness. Slowing of conduction in sensory fibers may also abolish the reflex by dispersing the afferent volley of impulses initiated by the tendon tap. There is generally a concordance between areflexia and a loss of proprioceptive and joint-position senses; that is, the large nerve fibers from spindle afferents are of the same type and size as those mediating these forms of sensation. Furthermore, loss of sensory functions that are dependent on these large fibers in the presence of preserved reflexes implicates the central projections of the sensory ganglion cells, that is, a lesion in the"]}, {"id": "seed_task_9999", "name": "MMLU_test_clinicalknowledge", "is_classification": true, "instruction": "In this task, you are given a question and four different answer options.

A small-bore needle is inserted through the skin and subcutaneous tissue into the vein. After documenting return of venous blood, a guidewire with a flexible tip is inserted through the needle into the vein, and the needle is withdrawn.

Two carbons enter the cycle as acetyl CoA and two leave as CO2. Therefore, the entry of one acetyl CoA into one round of the TCA cycle does not lead to the net production or consumption of intermediates. A. Acetyl CoA production The major source of acetyl CoA for the TCA cycle is the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate by the multienzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDH complex, or PDHC). However, the PDHC (described below) is not a component of the TCA cycle. Pyruvate, the end product of aerobic glycolysis, is transported from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix by the pyruvate mitochondrial carrier of the inner mitochondrial membrane. In the matrix,", "high and insulin is low (for example, as seen in fasting or diabetes). VII. ALTERNATE FATES OF PYRUVATE Pyruvate can be metabolized to products other than lactate. A. Oxidative decarboxylation to acetyl CoA Oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate by the PDHC is an important pathway in tissues with a high oxidative capacity such as cardiac muscle (Fig. 8.24). PDHC irreversibly converts pyruvate, the end product of aerobic glycolysis, into acetyl CoA, a TCA cycle substrate (see p. 109) and the carbon source for fatty acid synthesis (see p. 183). B. Carboxylation to oxaloacetate Carboxylation of pyruvate to oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase is a biotin-dependent reaction (see Fig. 8.24). This irreversible reaction is important because it replenishes the TCA cycle intermediate and provides substrate for gluconeogenesis (see p. 118). C.", "step 6 begins the energy-generation phase of glycolysis. Because two molecules of aTp are hydrolyzed in the early, energy-investment phase, glycolysis results in the net synthesis of 2 aTp and 2 naDh molecules per molecule of glucose (see also panel 2\u20138). Figure 2\u201347 Two pathways for the anaerobic breakdown of pyruvate. (a) When there is inadequate oxygen, for example, in a muscle cell undergoing vigorous contraction, the pyruvate produced by glycolysis is converted to lactate as shown. This reaction regenerates the naD+ consumed in step 6 of glycolysis, but the whole pathway yields much less energy overall than complete oxidation. (B) in some organisms that can grow anaerobically, such as yeasts, pyruvate is C regeneration C converted via acetaldehyde into carbon dioxide and ethanol. again, this pathway CO", "muscle and by cells that lack mitochondria such as RBC. In the Cori cycle, this lactate is taken up by the liver and oxidized to pyruvate that is converted to glucose, which is released back into the circulation (Fig. 10.2). C. Amino acids Amino acids produced by hydrolysis of tissue proteins are the major sources of glucose during a fast. Their metabolism generates \u03b1-keto acids, such as pyruvate that is converted to glucose, or \u03b1-ketoglutarate that can enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and form oxaloacetate (OAA), a direct precursor of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). [Note: Acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) and compounds that give rise only to acetyl CoA (for example, acetoacetate, lysine, and leucine) cannot give rise to a net synthesis of glucose. This is because of the irreversible", "the use of different start sites in transcription (see p. 473) of the gene that encodes the enzyme. K. Pyruvate reduction to lactate Lactate, formed from pyruvate by LDH, is the final product of anaerobic glycolysis in eukaryotic cells (Fig. 8.21). Reduction to lactate is the major fate for pyruvate in tissues that are poorly vascularized (for example, the lens and cornea of the eye and the kidney medulla) or in RBC that lack mitochondria. 1. Lactate formation in muscle: In exercising skeletal muscle, NADH production (by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and by the three NAD+-linked dehydrogenases of the TCA cycle, see p. 113) exceeds the oxidative capacity of the ETC. This results in an elevated NADH/NAD+ ratio, favoring reduction of pyruvate to lactate by LDH. Therefore, during intense", "diameter, and each requires a different enzyme. As is clear from Figure 2\u201363, the same molecule can often be part of many different pathways. Pyruvate, for example, is a substrate for half a dozen or more different enzymes, each of which modifies it chemically in a different way. One enzyme converts pyruvate to acetyl CoA, another to oxaloacetate; a third enzyme changes pyruvate to the amino acid alanine, a fourth to lactate, and so on. All of these different pathways compete for the same pyruvate molecule, and similar competitions for thousands of other small molecules go on at the same time. The situation is further complicated in a multicellular organism. Different cell types will in general require somewhat different sets of enzymes. And different tissues make distinct contributions", "A (CoA) and compounds that give rise only to acetyl CoA (for example, acetoacetate, lysine, and leucine) cannot give rise to a net synthesis of glucose. This is because of the irreversible nature of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC), which converts pyruvate to acetyl CoA (see p. 109). These compounds give rise instead to ketone bodies (see p. 195) and are termed ketogenic.] III. REACTIONS Seven glycolytic reactions are reversible and are used in the synthesis of glucose from lactate or pyruvate. However, three glycolytic reactions are irreversible and must be circumvented by four alternate reactions that energetically favor the synthesis of glucose. These irreversible reactions, which together are unique to gluconeogenesis, are described below. A. Pyruvate carboxylation The first roadblock to overcome in the synthesis of glucose", "poor perfusion. Lactic acidosis also occurs when specific reactions of pyruvate are impaired. In the liver, pyruvate undergoes carboxylation to form oxaloacetate using the enzyme pyruvate carboxylase; deficiency in this enzyme causes severe lactic acidosis. In many tissues, lactate is catabolized to form acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex; deficiency in pyruvate dehydrogenase also can cause lactic acidosis. Because these reactions also play a role in gluconeogenesis, hypoglycemia can be a feature of these disorders. These disorders comprise forms of primary lactic acidosis. They frequently present as intractable, lethal acidosis in the first days or weeks of life and are difficult to treat.

Finally, the best-interests criterion holds that proxies should evaluate treatments by balancing their benefits and risks and select those treatments in which the benefits maximally outweigh the burdens of treatment. Clinicians have a clear and crucial role in this by carefully and dispassionately explaining the known benefits and burdens of specific treatments. Yet even when that information is as clear as possible, different individuals can have very different views of what is in the patient\u2019s best interests, and families may have disagreements or even overt conflicts. This criterion has been criticized because there is no single way to determine the balance between benefits and burdens; it depends on a patient\u2019s personal values. For instance, for some people, being alive", "shares (everyone has the same number of health care dollars per year) Need (only those people who need health care get the dollars) Queuing (the first in line for a transplant gets it) Merit (those with more serious illnesses receive special benefits) Each of these principles could be appropriate as a measure of just allocation of health care dollars, but each will affect individual patients in different ways. Just distribution has become a major issue in health care. The principles of justice apply only when the resource is desired or beneficial and to some extent scarce (51).

Spread, or radiation of reflexes, is regularly associated with spasticity, although it may be observed to a slight degree in normal persons with brisk tendon reflexes. Tapping of the radial periosteum, for example, may elicit a reflex contraction not only of the brachioradialis but also of the biceps, triceps, or finger flexors. This spread of reflex activity is probably not the result of radiation of impulses in the spinal cord, but a result of the propagation of a vibration wave from bone to muscle, stimulating the excitable muscle spindles in its path (Lance).

If sensory nerve action potentials can be recorded normally at the wrist following stimulation of the digital fibers in the affected finger, the pathology is probably proximal to the dorsal root ganglia (i.e., there is a radiculopathy or more central lesion); absence of the sensory potentials, by contrast, suggests distal pathology.

The plantar reflexes, particularly the elicitation of the Babinski sign by stroking the lateral sole of the foot from heel to toe, are an essential part of most examinations. The sign is a dependable marker of damage to the corticospinal system as described in Chap. 3. The main features of the Babinski sign are dorsiflexion of the large toe and fanning of the other toes.

Malalignment develops over years as a consequence of gradual anatomic alterations of the joint and bone, and correcting it is often very challeng ing. One way is with a fitted brace, which takes an often varus osteoarthritic knee and straightens it by putting valgus stress across the", "do not require the painful part to be moved is a way around this difficulty. Ascertaining the extent and severity of muscle weakness requires a systematic examination of the main groups of muscles. The patient is asked to contract each group with as much force as possible, while the examiner opposes the movement and offers a graded resistance in accordance with the degree of residual power (isokinetic contraction). Alternatively, the patient is asked to produce a maximal contraction and the examiner estimates power by the force needed to overcome or \u201cbreak\u201d it (isometric contraction or maximum voluntary isometric contraction).

New dosage forms of opioids that allow slower release of the drug are now available, eg, sustained-release forms of morphine (MS Contin) and oxycodone (OxyContin). Their purported advantage is a longer and more stable level of analgesia. However, there is little evidence to support long-term (greater than 6 months) use of sustained-release opioids to manage chronic pain in the noncancer patient. Furthermore, attempts to control chronic pain with opioids alone may lead to excessive use and dependence (see Box: Educating Opioid Prescribers). If disturbances of gastrointestinal function prevent the use of oral sustained-release morphine, then a fentanyl transdermal system (fentanyl patch) can be used over long periods.

In patients with borderline lung function but a resectable tumor, cardiopulmonary exercise testing could be performed as part of the physiologic evaluation. This test allows an estimate of the maximal oxygen consumption (Vo ). A Vo <15 mL/(kg\u22c5min) predicts for a higher risk of postoperative complications.

Thus, the largest change in diagnostic likelihood following a test result occurs when the clinician is most uncertain (i.e., pretest probability between 30% and 70%). For example, if a patient has a pretest probability for CAD of 50%, a positive exercise treadmill test will move the posttest probability to 80% and a positive exercise SPECT perfusion test will move it to 90% (Fig. 3-2). As presented above, Bayes\u2019 rule employs a number of important simplifications that should be considered. First, few tests have only positive or negative results, and many tests provide multiple outcomes (e.g., ST-segment depression and exercise duration with exercise testing). Although Bayes\u2019 rule can be adapted to this more detailed test result format, it is computationally", "probability of disease is about 95%. In contrast, exercise SPECT myocardial perfusion test is more accurate for CAD. For simplicity, assume that the finding of a reversible exercise-induced perfusion defect has both a sensitivity and a specificity of 90%, yielding a likelihood ratio for a positive test of 9.0 (0.90/ [1 \u2013 0.90]) (consistent with moderate discriminatory ability because it falls between 5 and 10). For the same 10% pretest probability patient, a positive test raises the probability of CAD to 50% (Fig. 3-2). However, despite the differences in posttest probabilities between these two tests (30% versus 50%), the more accurate test may not improve diagnostic likelihood enough to change patient management (e.g., decision to refer to cardiac catheterization) because the more accurate test has only moved the", "versus 50%), the more accurate test may not improve diagnostic likelihood enough to change patient management (e.g., decision to refer to cardiac catheterization) because the more accurate test has only moved the physician from being fairly certain that the patient did not have CAD to a 50:50 chance of disease. In a patient with a pretest probability of 80%, exercise SPECT test raises the posttest probability to 97% (compared with 95% for the exercise treadmill). Again, the more accurate test does not provide enough improvement in posttest confidence to alter management, and neither test has improved much on what was known from clinical data alone.

During skeletal muscle depolarization, short activation of these sensors is not sufficient to open Ca2 channels. Thus, Ca2 transport from the lumen of the T tubule into the sarcoplasm does not occur and is not essential to trigger the contraction cycle. Instead, activation of these sensors opens gated Ca2-release channels in adjacent terminal sacs of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, causing the rapid release of Ca2 into the sarcoplasm. The increased concentration of Ca2 in the sarcoplasm initiates contraction of the myofibril by binding to the TnC portion of the troponin complex on the thin filaments (see page 316). The change in molecular conformation of TnC causes the TnI to dissociate from the actin molecules, allowing the troponin complex to uncover myosin-binding sites on the actin molecules.

As in striated muscle, contraction is initiated by an increase in the Ca2 concentration in the cytosol, but the contraction does not act through a troponin\u2013tropomyosin complex on the thin filament. Rather, in smooth muscle, an increase in Ca2 concentration stimulates a myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) to phosphorylate one of the two regulatory light chains of the myosin molecule. The Ca2 binds to calmodulin to form the Ca2\u2013calmodulin complex, which in turn binds to MLCK to activate the phosphorylation reaction of the regulatory light chain of myosin (Fig. 11.23). When the light chain is phosphorylated, the actin-binding site of the myosin head is activated and attaches to actin.

Step 3: The muscle contracts when ADP dissociates from the cross-bridge. This step leads to the formation of the low-energy rigor complex (lower left) in which the chemical energy derived from ATP hydrolysis has been expended to perform mechanical work (the \u201crowing\u201d motion of the cross-bridge).

Repetitive interaction between myosin heads and actin filaments is termed cross-bridge cycling, which results in sliding of the actin along the myosin filaments, ultimately causing muscle shortening and/or the development of tension. The splitting of ATP then dissociates the myosin cross-bridge from actin. In the presence of ATP (Fig. 265e-5), linkages between actin and myosin filaments are made and broken cyclically as long as sufficient Ca2+ is present; these linkages cease when [Ca2+] falls below a critical level, and the troponintropomyosin complex once more prevents interactions between the myosin cross-bridges and actin filaments (Fig. 265e-6).

When cytosolic Ca2+ concentration is low, as in relaxed muscle, the reaction cannot proceed because tropomyosin and the troponin complex on the thin filament do not allow the active sites on actin to interact with the cross-bridges. Therefore, even though the cross-bridges are energized, they cannot interact with actin.

The force of contraction can be increased by the activation of more motor neurons (i.e., recruiting of more muscle fibers) or by an increase in the frequency of action potentials in the muscle fiber, which produces tetany.

A high concentration of Ca2+-binding proteins in the ER facilitates Ca2+ storage. In some cell types, and perhaps in most, specific regions of the ER are specialized for Ca2+ storage. Muscle cells have an abundant, modified smooth ER called the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The release and reuptake of Ca2+ by the sarcoplasmic reticulum trigger myofibril contraction and relaxation, respectively, during each round of muscle contraction (discussed in Chapter 16). To study the functions and biochemistry of the ER, it is necessary to isolate", "Ca2+ pump, or Ca2+ ATPase, in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane of skeletal muscle cells is a well-understood P-type transport ATPase. The SR is a specialized type of endoplasmic reticulum that forms a network of tubular sacs in the muscle cell cytoplasm, and it serves as an intracellular store of Ca2+. When an action potential depolarizes the muscle cell plasma membrane, Ca2+ is released into the cytosol from the SR through Ca2+-release channels, stimulating the muscle to contract (discussed in Chapters 15 and 16). The Ca2+ pump, which accounts for about 90% of the membrane protein of the SR, moves Ca2+ from the cytosol back into the SR. The endoplasmic reticulum of nonmuscle cells contains a similar Ca2+ pump, but in smaller quantities. Enzymatic studies and analyses of", "are activated during a contraction, and so recruiting more muscle cells is not an option. Moreover, tetany of cardiac muscle cells would prevent any pumping action and thus be fatal. Consequently, the heart relies on different means of increasing the force of contraction, including varying the amplitude of the intracellular Ca++ transient. Relaxation of Cardiac Muscle Relaxation of skeletal muscle simply requires reaccumulation of Ca++ by the SR through the action of the sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase (SERCA), also known as the SR Ca++ pump. Although SERCA plays a key role in the decrease in cytosolic [Ca++] in cardiac muscle, the process is more complex than that in skeletal muscle because some trigger Ca++ enters the cardiac muscle cell through the sarcolemmal calcium channels during each action potential.", "release channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (see below). Calcium sparks directly augment intracellular calcium concentration and indirectly increase intracellular calcium concentration by activating chloride channels. In addition, calcium sparks reduce smooth-muscle contractility by activating large-conductance calcium-sensitive K+ channels, hyperpolarizing the cell membrane and thereby limiting further voltage-dependent increases in intracellular calcium. Biochemical agonists also increase intracellular calcium concentration, in this case by receptor-dependent activation of phospholipase C with hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, resulting in the generation of diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3). These membrane lipid derivatives in turn activate protein kinase C and increase intracellular calcium concentration. In addition, IP3 binds to specific receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane to increase calcium efflux from this calcium storage pool into the cytoplasm. Vascular smooth-muscle cell contraction depends principally", "activate phospholipase C (PLC) (see ). PLC hydrolyzes the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) into InsP3 and diacylglycerol. InsP3 then diffuses to the SR and opens the InsP3-gated Ca++ channel, thereby resulting in release of Ca++ from the SR into the myoplasm. This complex process may permit graded release of Ca++ from the SR and also enable many different neurotransmitters and hormones to effect smooth muscle contraction. Calcium is reaccumulated by the SR through the activity of the SERCA, although as indicated later, extrusion of Ca++ from the smooth muscle cell also contributes to the reduction in myoplasmic [Ca++]. Refilling of the SR with Ca++ not only involves reaccumulation of cytosolic Ca++ but also depends on the extracellular [Ca++].

As might be expected, the contribution of various electrogenic transporters to the Vm is highly variable from cell to cell. For example, the Na+,K+-ATPase channel transports three Na+ and two K+ ions and thus transfers one net positive charge across the membrane.

In general, the hydrophobic and van der Waals forces operate over very short ranges and serve to pull together two surfaces that are complementary in shape: hills on one surface must fit into valleys on the other for good binding to occur.

It is difficult to control this type of therapy adequately even with frequent x-ray examination of the epiphyses, since the action of the hormones on epiphyseal centers may continue for many months after therapy is discontinued. G. Anabolic Steroid and Androgen Abuse in Sports The use of anabolic steroids by athletes has received worldwide attention. Many athletes and their coaches believe that anabolic steroids\u2014in doses 10\u2013200 times larger than the daily normal physiologic production\u2014increase strength and aggressiveness, thereby improving competitive performance. Such effects have been unequivocally demonstrated only in women. Furthermore, the adverse effects of these drugs clearly make their use inadvisable. As a result, most sports organizations have developed extremely sensitive assays, conduct random testing,", "signals that trigger muscle-cell specification, for example, turn on the transcription of a series of genes that encode muscle-specific transcription regulatory proteins, which stimulate the transcription of their own genes, as well as genes encoding various other muscle-cell proteins; in this way, the decision to become a muscle cell is made permanent. This type of cell memory, which depends on positive feedback, is one of the basic ways in which a cell can undergo a lasting change of character without any alteration in its DNA sequence. Studies of signaling responses in large populations of cells can give the false impression that a response is smoothly graded, even when strong positive feedback is causing an abrupt, discontinuous switch in the response in individual cells. Only by studying the response", "implications for medical applications that go far beyond the traditional goals of disease prevention, treatment, and cure. Cloning, genetic engineering, gene therapy, human\u2013computer interfaces, nanotechnology, and use of designer drugs have the potential to modify inherited predispositions to disease, select desired characteristics in embryos, augment \u201cnormal\u201d human performance, replace failing tissues, and substantially prolong life span. Given their unique training, physicians have a responsibility to help shape the debate on the appropriate uses of and limits placed on these new techniques and to consider carefully the ethical issues associated with the implementation of such interventions.

These claims are largely unsubstantiated. In contrast, studies in mice and the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans have clearly demonstrated that analogs of human GH and IGF-I consistently shorten life span and that loss-of-function mutations in the signaling pathways for the GH and IGF-I analogs lengthen life span. Another use of GH is by athletes for a purported increase in muscle mass and athletic performance. Growth hormone is one of the drugs banned by the International Olympic Committee.

Changes due to mistakes of the second type\u2014selectively neutral changes\u2014may be perpetuated or not: in the competition for limited resources, it is a matter of chance whether the altered cell or its cousins will succeed. But changes that cause serious damage lead nowhere: the cell that suffers them dies, leaving no progeny.

Some parts of the genome will change more easily than others in the course of evolution. A segment of DNA that does not code for protein and has no significant regulatory role is free to change at a rate limited only by the frequency of random errors. In contrast, a gene that codes for a highly optimized essential protein or RNA molecule cannot alter so easily: when mistakes occur, the faulty cells are almost always eliminated. Genes of this latter sort are therefore highly conserved. Through 3.5 billion years or more of evolutionary history, many features of the genome have changed beyond all recognition, but the most highly conserved genes remain perfectly recognizable in all living", "however, neither emtricitabine nor the combination is approved yet for hepatitis B. Several initially promising antiviral agents have been abandoned because of toxicity (e.g., clevudine, which was linked to myopathy during its clinical development).

The most often cited study of the prognostic aspects of coma following cardiac arrest in the past had been by Levy and colleagues of 210 patients, which provided the following guidelines: 13 percent of patients attained a state of independent function within 1 year; at the time of the initial evaluation, approximately 25 percent of patients had absent pupillary light reflexes, none of whom regained independent function; by contrast, the presence on admission of reactive pupils, eye movements, and any motor response, a configuration displayed in approximately 10 percent, was associated with", "control of bleeding is accomplished through the use of direct pressure.

This allows for further gradations in the level of consciousness based on the intensity of stimulation that is necessary to produce arousal. The patient who is incapable of being aroused by external stimuli or inner need, comatose. There are variations in the degree of coma, and the findings and signs depend on the underlying cause of the disorder. In its deepest stages, no meaningful or purposeful reaction of any kind is obtainable and corneal, pupillary, pharyngeal responses are diminished. In lighter stages, sometimes referred to by the ambiguous", "injury, the Glasgow Coma Scale was devised; empirically, it has predictive value in cases of brain trauma (see Table 457e-2). For anoxic and metabolic coma, clinical signs such as the pupillary and motor responses after 1 day, 3 days, and 1 week have been shown to have predictive value. Other studies suggest that the absence of corneal responses may have the most discriminative value. The absence of the cortical waves of the somatosensory evoked potentials has also proved a strong indicator of poor outcome in coma from any cause. The uniformly poor outcome of the prolonged vegetative state has already been mentioned, but recent reports that a small number of such patients display consistent cortical activation on functional MRI in response to salient stimuli have begun to alter", "in eliciting abduction withdrawal movements of the limbs. Posturing in response to noxious stimuli indicates severe damage to the corticospinal system, whereas abduction-avoidance movement of a limb is usually purposeful and denotes an intact corticospinal system. Posturing may also be unilateral and coexist with purposeful limb movements, reflecting incomplete damage to the motor system. Assessment of brainstem function is essential to localization of the lesion in coma (Fig. 328-3). The brainstem reflexes that are examined are pupillary size and reaction to light, spontaneous and elicited eye movements, corneal responses, and the respiratory pattern.

The intensity of the murmur of MR does not change in the post-premature beat as there is relatively little further increase in mitral valve flow or change in the left ventricular\u2013left atrial gradient. Additional clues to the etiology and importance of a heart murmur can be gleaned from the history and other physical examination findings. Symptoms suggestive of cardiovascular, neurologic, or pulmonary disease help focus the differential", "can involve only one valve (the mitral valve being the most common target), or more than one valve. Turbulent flow through diseased valves typically produces abnormal heart sounds called murmurs; severe lesions can even be externally palpated as thrills. Depending on the valve involved, murmurs are best heard at different locations on the chest wall; moreover, the nature (regurgitation versus stenosis) and severity of the valvular disease determines the quality and timing of the murmur (e.g., harsh systolic or soft diastolic murmurs). http://ebooksmedicine.net The outcome of valvular disease depends on the valve involved, the degree of impairment, the tempo of its development, and the effectiveness of compensatory mechanisms. For example, rapid destruction of an aortic valve cusp by infection can cause massive regurgitation and the abrupt onset of", "mid-systolic murmur to the apex, where it becomes higher-pitched, is common (Gallavardin effect; see above). Differentiation of this apical systolic murmur from MR can be difficult. The murmur of AS will increase in intensity, or become louder, in the beat after a premature beat, whereas the murmur of MR will have constant intensity from beat to beat. The intensity of the AS murmur also varies directly with the cardiac output. With a normal cardiac output, a systolic thrill and a grade 4 or higher murmur suggest severe AS. The murmur is softer in the setting of heart failure and low cardiac output. Other auscultatory findings of severe AS include a soft or absent A2, paradoxical splitting of S2, an apical S4, and a late-peaking systolic murmur. In children,", "vasodilators, whereas the murmur of MS may be accompanied by an opening snap and also may increase in intensity after vasodilators because of the associated increase in cardiac output. Unusual causes of a mid-diastolic murmur include atrial myxoma, complete heart block, and acute rheumatic mitral valvulitis. Continuous Murmur A continuous murmur is predicated on a pressure gradient that persists between two cardiac chambers or blood vessels across systole and diastole. The murmurs typically begin in systole, envelop the second heart sound (S2), and continue through some portion of diastole. They can often be difficult to distinguish from individual systolic and diastolic murmurs in patients with mixed valvular heart disease. The classic example of a continuous murmur is that associated with a PDA, which usually is heard in the", "and response to bedside maneuvers. Although clinicians can detect and correctly identify heart murmurs with only fair reliability, a careful and complete bedside examination usually can identify individuals with valvular heart disease for whom transthoracic echocardiography and clinical follow-up are indicated and exclude subjects for whom no further evaluation is necessary. Systolic murmurs can be early, mid, late, or holosystolic in timing (Fig. 267-5). Acute severe MR results in a decrescendo early systolic murmur, the characteristics of which are related to the progressive attenuation of the left ventricular to left atrial pressure gradient during systole because of the steep and rapid rise in left atrial pressure in this context. Severe MR associated with posterior leaflet prolapse or flail radiates anteriorly and to the base, where it can be", "the aortic position is always associated with a grade 2 to 3 midsystolic murmur at the base or just below the suprasternal notch. A diastolic murmur of AR is abnormal in any circumstance. Mechanical valve dysfunction may first be suggested by a decrease in the intensity of either the opening or the closing sound. A high-pitched apical systolic murmur in patients with a mechanical mitral prosthesis and a diastolic decrescendo murmur in patients with a mechanical aortic prosthesis indicate paravalvular regurgitation. Patients with prosthetic valve thrombosis may present clinically with signs of shock, muffled heart sounds, and soft murmurs.

A click implies a valvular abnormality or dilated great artery. It may be ejection or midsystolic in timing and may or may not be associated with a murmur.

Left ventricular diastolic pressure may increase sufficiently to result in premature closure of the mitral valve and a soft first heart sound.

First, patient expectations of pain relief are low and they are not aware of the extent of analgesia that they should expect. In a study of the perception of pain relief after surgery, 86% of patients had moderate to severe pain after surgery, but 70% felt that the pain was as severe as they expected (40).

The patient can then titrate the dose to the optimal level. This approach is used most extensively for the management of postoperative pain, but there is no reason why it should not be used for any hospitalized patient with persistent severe pain.

LIVER IN FASTING The primary role of the liver in fasting is maintenance of blood glucose through the production of glucose (from glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis) for glucose-requiring tissues and the synthesis and distribution of ketone bodies for use by other tissues. Therefore, hepatic metabolism is distinguished from peripheral (or extrahepatic) metabolism. A. Carbohydrate metabolism The liver first uses glycogen degradation and then gluconeogenesis to maintain blood glucose levels to sustain energy metabolism of the brain and other glucose-requiring tissues in the fasted state. [Note: Recall that the presence of glucose-6-phosphatase in the liver allows the production of free glucose both from glycogenolysis and", "1-phosphate is converted to glucose 6-phosphate by phosphoglucomutase. In muscle, glucose 6phosphate enters glycolysis. In liver, the phosphate is removed by glucose 6-phosphatase (an enzyme of the endoplasmic reticular membrane), releasing free glucose that can be used to maintain blood glucose levels at the beginning of a fast. A deficiency of the phosphatase causes glycogen storage disease Ia (von Gierke disease) and results in an inability of the liver to provide free glucose to the body during a fast. It affects both glycogen degradation and gluconeogenesis. Glycogen synthesis and degradation are reciprocally regulated to meet whole-body needs by the same hormonal signals (namely, an elevated insulin level results in overall increased glycogenesis and decreased glycogenolysis, whereas an elevated glucagon, or epinephrine, level causes the opposite effects). Key enzymes", "three categories ( Table 7.4 Hepatic type. Liver contains several enzymes that synthesize glycogen for storage and also break it down into free glucose. Hence, a deficiency of the hepatic enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism is associated with two major clinical effects: enlargement of the liver due to storage of glycogen and hypoglycemia due to a failure of glucose production ( Fig. 7.12 ). Von Gierke disease (type I glycogenosis), resulting from a lack of glucose-6phosphatase, is the most important example of the hepatic form of glycogenosis ( Table 7.4 Myopathic type.

Because colon neoplasms bleed intermittently and rarely present with rapid hemorrhage, the presence of occult fecal blood should always prompt a colonoscopy. Unexplained iron-deficiency anemia is also an indication for colonoscopy.Hematochezia is commonly caused by hemorrhoids or a fissure.

An ultrasound probe may be placed into the rectum to assess the gynecological structures in females and the prostate in the male before performing a prostatic biopsy.

Presentation and Evaluation Patients commonly present to a physician for two reasons: bleeding and protrusion. Pain is less common than with fissures and, if present, is described as a dull ache from engorgement of the hemorrhoidal tissue. Severe pain may indicate a thrombosed hemorrhoid. Hemorrhoidal bleeding is described as painless bright red blood seen either in the toilet or upon wiping. Occasional patients can present with significant bleeding, which may be a cause of anemia; however, the presence of a colonic neoplasm must be ruled out in anemic patients. Patients who present with a protruding mass complain about inability to maintain perianal hygiene and are often concerned about the presence of a malignancy. The diagnosis of hemorrhoidal disease is made on physical examination. Inspection of", "in the rectosigmoid. For unexplained reasons, however, the proportion of large-bowel cancers arising in the rectum has been decreasing during the past several decades, with a corresponding increase in the proportion of cancers in the more proximal descending colon. As such, the potential for proctosigmoidoscopy to detect a sufficient number of occult neoplasms to make the procedure cost-effective has been questioned. Screening strategies for colorectal cancer that have been examined during the past several decades are listed in Table 110-3. Many programs directed at the early detection of colorectal cancers have focused on digital rectal examinations and fecal occult blood (i.e., stool guaiac) testing. The digital examination should be part of any routine physical evaluation in adults older than age 40 years, serving as a screening test for", "surgery should be rare.Anorectal Pain. Anorectal pain is most often secondary to an anal fissure, perirectal abscess and/or fistula, or a throm-bosed hemorrhoid. Physical examination can usually differenti-ate these conditions. Other, less common causes of anorectal pain include anal canal neoplasms, perianal skin infection, and dermatologic conditions. Proctalgia fugax results from levator spasm and may present without any other anorectal findings. Physical exam is critical in evaluating patients with anorec-tal pain. If a patient is too tender to examine in the office, an examination under anesthesia is necessary. MRI or other imag-ing studies may be helpful in select cases where the etiology of pain is elusive.Lower Gastrointestinal Bleeding.

In all patients with bleeding, the possibility of other causes must be considered. In young patients without a family history of colorectal cancer, the hemorrhoidal disease may be treated first and a colonoscopic examination performed if the bleeding continues. Older patients who have not had colorectal cancer screening should undergo colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy.

Epidemiology Reveals That Many Cases of Cancer Are Preventable A certain irreducible background incidence of cancer is to be expected regardless of circumstances. As discussed in Chapter 5, mutations can never be absolutely avoided because they are an inescapable consequence of fundamental limitations on the accuracy of DNA replication and repair. If a person could live long enough, it is inevitable that at least one of his or her cells would eventually accumulate a set of mutations sufficient for cancer to develop. Nevertheless, environmental factors seem to play a large part in determining the risk for cancer. This is demonstrated most clearly by a comparison of cancer incidence in different countries: for almost every cancer", "than survival after diagnosis, is the preferred endpoint (see below). Because screening is done on asymptomatic, healthy persons, it should offer substantial likelihood of benefit that outweighs harm. Screening tests and their appropriate use should be carefully evaluated before their use is widely encouraged in screening programs, as a matter of public policy. A large and increasing number of genetic mutations and nucleotide polymorphisms have been associated with an increased risk of cancer. Testing for these genetic mutations could in theory define a high-risk population. However, most of the identified mutations have very low penetrance and individually provide minimal predictive accuracy. The ability to predict the development of a particular cancer may some day present therapeutic options as well as ethical dilemmas. It may eventually allow for early", "you repeated the experiment to confirm them. Both sets of results display the same extreme variability, as shown in Table Q5\u20131.

If mismatches were instead repaired without regard for which strand served as template, would mismatch repair reduce replication errors?

Maintaining the genetic stability that an organism needs for its survival requires not only an extremely accurate mechanism for replicating DNA, but also mechanisms for repairing the many accidental lesions that DNA continually suffers. Most such spontaneous changes in DNA are temporary because they are immediately corrected by a set of processes that are collectively called DNA repair. Of the tens of thousands of random changes created every day in the DNA of a human cell by heat, metabolic accidents, radiation of various sorts, and exposure to substances in the environment, only a few (less than 0.02%) accumulate as permanent mutations in the DNA sequence. The rest are eliminated with remarkable efficiency by DNA repair. The importance of DNA repair is evident from the", "billions of cells experience mutations every day, potentially disrupting the social controls. Most dangerously, a mutation may give one cell a selective advantage, allowing it to grow and divide slightly more vigorously and survive more readily than its neighbors and in this way to become a founder of a growing mutant clone. A mutation that promotes such selfish behavior by individual members of the cooperative can jeopardize the future of the whole enterprise. Over time, repeated rounds of mutation, competition, and natural selection operating within the population of somatic cells can cause matters to go from bad to worse.

If the sugar is deoxyribose, the nucleotide is a deoxyribonucleoside phosphate (for example, deoxyAMP) and will be found almost exclusively as a component of DNA. The committed step in purine synthesis uses 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate ([PRPP], an activated pentose that provides the ribose 5-phosphate for de novo purine and pyrimidine synthesis and salvage) and nitrogen from glutamine to produce phosphoribosylamine.

Somatic hypermutation involves both mutation at the original cytidines targeted by AID and mutation at nearby non-cytidine nucleotides. If the original U:G mismatch is recognized by UNG, then an abasic site will be generated in the DNA (see Fig. 10.19).

Intrathoracic pressure is increased relative to atmospheric pressure during exhalation, which tends to collapse the intrathoracic airways and accentuates airway narrowing on expiration. This manifests as expiratory wheeze, prolonged expiratory phase, and increased expiratory work of breathing. In patients with chronic airway infection (e.g., cystic fibrosis), the bronchi become permanently damaged and dilated (bronchiectasis). Patients with bronchiectasis have episodes of cough, often productive of purulent sputum, and may have inspiratory crackles. When asthma is suspected, empiric trials of therapy (bronchodilators, short courses of oral corticosteroids, long-term use of inhaled corticosteroids) are useful in arriving at a diagnosis. In children older than 6 years, pulmonary function tests (spirometry) can assess airflow obstruction", "breathing. Turbulence is also promoted by the glottis and vocal cords, which produce some irregularity and obstruction in the airways. As gas flows distally the total cross-sectional area increases dramatically, and gas velocities decrease significantly. As a result, gas flow becomes more laminar in the smaller airways even during maximal ventilation. Overall the gas flow in the larger airways (nose, mouth, glottis, and bronchi) is turbulent, whereas the gas flow in the smaller airways is laminar. Breath sounds heard with a stethoscope reflect turbulent airflow. Laminar flow is silent, which is why it is difficult to \u201chear\u201d small airway disease with a stethoscope. Airflow resistance is the second major factor that determines rates of airflow in the airways. Airflow resistance in the airways (Raw) differs in airways of", "fixed upper-airway obstruction typically leads to inspiratory and/or expiratory flow plateaus (Fig. 306e-4). AirwAys resistAnce The total resistance of the pulmonary and upper airways is measured in the same body plethysmograph used to measure FRC. The patient is asked once again to pant, but this time against a closed and then opened shutter. Panting against the closed shutter reveals the thoracic gas volume as described above. When the shutter is opened, flow is directed to and from the body box, so that volume fluctuations in the box reveal the extent of thoracic gas compression, which in turn reveals the pressure fluctuations driving flow. Simultaneous measurement of flow allows the calculation of lung resistance (as flow divided by pressure). In health, Raw is very low (<2 cmH2O/L per second),", "peak expiratory flow increases. However, the flow rates at lower lung volumes converge; this indicates that with modest effort, maximal expiratory flow is achieved. No amount of effort will increase the flow rates as lung volume decreases. For this reason, expiratory flow rates at lower lung volumes are said to be effort independent and flow limited because maximal flow is achieved with modest effort, and no amount of additional effort can increase the flow rate beyond this limit. In contrast, events early in the expiratory maneuver are said to be effort dependent; that is, increasing effort generates increasing flow rates. In general the first 20% of the flow in the expiratory flow-volume loop is effort dependent. Flow Limitation and the Equal Pressure Point Why is expiratory flow limited", "excessive airway collapsibility (e.g., tracheomalacia) also reduce maximal expiratory flow. The Bernoulli effect also applies during inspiration, but the more negative pleural pressures during inspiration lower the pressure outside of airways, thereby increasing transmural pressure and promoting airway expansion. Thus inspiratory airflow limitation seldom occurs due to diffuse pulmonary airway disease. Conversely, extrathoracic airway narrowing (e.g., due to a tracheal adenoma or post-tracheostomy stricture) can lead to inspiratory airflow limitation (Fig. 306e-4). The Work of Breathing In health, the elastic (volume change\u2013related) and dynamic (flow-related) loads that must be overcome to ventilate the lungs at rest are small, and the work required of the respiratory muscles is minimal. However, the work of breathing can A BC This volume is called the anatomic 306e-3 dead space (VD). Quiet breathing", "volumes, and thus the elastic work of each tidal breath is also increased. The dynamic pulmonary hyperinflation that accompanies severe airflow obstruction causes patients to sense difficulty in inhaling\u2014even though the root cause of this pathophysiologic abnormality is expiratory airflow obstruction. Adequacy of Ventilation As noted above, the respiratory control system that sets the rate of ventilation responds to chemical signals, including arterial CO2 and oxygen tensions and blood pH, and to volitional needs, such as the need to inhale deeply before playing a long phrase on the trumpet. Disturbances in ventilation are discussed in Chap. 318. The focus of this chapter is on the relationship between ventilation of the lung and CO2 elimination.

Bronchospasm can be precipitated by esophageal acidification and cough by either acid stimulation or distention of the esophagus.Dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, is a relatively non-specific term but arguably the most specific symptom of foregut disease.

A deep breath preceding a cough optimizes the function of the expiratory muscles; a series of repetitive coughs at successively lower lung volumes sweeps the point of maximal expiratory velocity progressively further into the lung periphery. Weak or ineffective cough compromises the ability to clear lower respiratory tract infections, predisposing to more serious infections and their sequelae. Weakness, paralysis, or pain of the expiratory (abdominal and intercostal) muscles is foremost on the list of causes of impaired cough (Table 48-1). Cough strength is generally assessed qualitatively; peak expiratory flow or maximal expiratory pressure at the mouth can be used as a surrogate marker for cough strength.

A yet more accurate test of vagal function is the measurement of the ratio of the longest R-R interval during forceful slow expiration (standardized as constant blowing at a pressure of 40 mm Hg for 10 s) to the shortest R-R interval during inspiration, which allows the derivation of an expiration\u2013inspiration (E:I) ratio.

At greater intensities, the uterine wall then becomes so hard that it resists easy depression. Uterine contractions usually are not associated with pain until their strength exceeds 15 mm Hg. Presumably, this is the minimum pressure required to distend the lower uterine segment and cervix.

In cases where a drug concentration is too low to be detected early during clinical evaluation, repeating the test at a later time may yield a positive result. Patients symptomatic from drugs of abuse often require immediate management based on the history, physical examination, and observed toxidrome without laboratory confirmation (e.g., apnea from opioid intoxication).

This condition is usually accompanied by some impairment in thinking, concentration, and perceptual and psychomotor function. Higher doses of cannabis may produce more pronounced impairment in concentration and perception, as well as greater sedation. Although the acute effects of marijuana intoxication are relatively benign in normal users, the drug can precipitate severe emotional disorders in individuals who have antecedent psychotic or neurotic problems. Like other psychoactive compounds, both the user\u2019s expectations and the environmental context are important determinants of the type and severity of the effects of marijuana intoxication. As with abuse of cocaine, opioids, and alcohol, chronic marijuana abusers may lose interest in common socially desirable goals", "individuals are often brought to the acute-care setting when it occurs. However, the disability is typically self- limited and resolves upon removal of the offending agent. Substance intoxication or substance withdrawal. Individuals intoxicated with stimu- lants, cannabis, the opioid meperidine, or phencyclidine, or those withdrawing from alco- hol or sedatives, may experience altered perceptions that they recognize as drug effects. If reality testing for these experiences remains intact (i.e., the individual recognizes that the perception is substance induced and neither believes in nor acts on it), the diagnosis is not substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder. Instead, substance intoxication or substance withdrawal, with perceptual disturbances, is diagnosed (e.g., cocaine intoxica- tion, with perceptual disturbances). \u201dFlashback\u201d hallucinations that can occur long after the use of hallucinogens has stopped are diagnosed as hallucinogen", "carbamazepine.

These areas are crucial for planning and executing motor behavior.

Obviously, such complex psychologic activity must implicate many parts of the cerebrum and will suffer to some extent from a lesion in any of the parts that contribute to the functional system.

The fact that those who were merely dazed did as poorly as those who were concussed and that litigation was involved in some cases would lead one to question these results.

Because the majority of studies have been focused on the regulation and functions of proteins, this chapter primarily focuses on how protein-encoding mRNA is made by RNA polymerase II.Translation. DNA directs the synthesis of RNA; RNA in turn directs the synthesis of proteins. Proteins are variable-length polypeptide polymers composed of various combinations of 20 different amino acids and are the working molecules of the cell. The process of decoding information on mRNA to synthesize proteins is called translation (see Fig. 15-1). Translation takes place", "tRNAs to translate a specific sequence of A, C, G, and U nucleotides in an mRNA molecule into a specific sequence of amino acids in a protein molecule occurs on the ribosome, a large multimolecular machine composed of both protein and ribosomal RNA. All of these processes are described in detail in Chapter 6. DNA molecules as a rule are very large, containing the specifications for thousands of proteins. Special sequences in the DNA serve as punctuation, defining where the information for each protein begins and ends. And individual segments of the long DNA sequence are transcribed into separate mRNA molecules, coding for different proteins. Each such DNA segment represents one gene. A complication is that RNA molecules transcribed from the same DNA segment can often be processed", "sequence is translated into an amino acid sequence using the tRNAs as adaptors to add each amino acid in the correct sequence to the growing end of the polypeptide chain. When a stop codon is encountered, the ribosome releases the finished protein, and its two subunits separate again. These subunits can then be used to start the synthesis of another protein on another mRNA molecule. Ribosomes operate with remarkable efficiency: in one second, a eukaryotic ribosome adds 2 amino acids to a polypeptide chain; the ribosomes of bacterial cells operate even faster, at a rate of about 20 amino acids per second. To choreograph the many coordinated movements required for efficient translation, a ribosome contains four binding sites for RNA molecules: one is for the mRNA and three", "amounts of genetic information required by such cells.

Before the synthesis of a particular protein can begin, the corresponding mRNA molecule must be produced by transcription. Bacteria contain a single type of RNA polymerase (the enzyme that carries out the transcription of DNA into RNA). An mRNA molecule is produced after this enzyme initiates transcription at a promoter, synthesizes the RNA by chain elongation, stops transcription at a terminator, and releases both the DNA template and the completed mRNA molecule. In eukaryotic cells, the process of transcription is much more complex, and there are three RNA polymerases\u2014polymerase I, II, and III\u2014that are related evolutionarily to one another and to the bacterial polymerase. RNA polymerase II synthesizes eukaryotic mRNA. This enzyme requires a", "determinant of the rate at which any particular protein will be synthesized. We shall see in Chapter 7 how regulation of this step occurs. The translation of an mRNA begins with the codon AUG, and a special tRNA is required to start translation. This initiator tRNA always carries the amino acid methionine (in bacteria, a modified form of methionine\u2014formylmethionine\u2014is used), with the result that all newly made proteins have methionine as the first amino acid at their N-terminus, the end of a protein that is synthesized first. (This methionine is usually removed later by a specific protease.) The initiator tRNA is specially recognized by initiation factors because it has a nucleotide sequence distinct from that of the tRNA that normally carries methionine.

Transcription often is coupled with translation in such a way that an mRNA molecule is completely accessible to ribosomes, and bacterial protein synthesis begins on an mRNA molecule even while it is still being synthesized. Therefore, a discussion of gene regulation with a look at the simpler prokary-otic system precedes that of the more complex transcription and posttranscriptional regulation of eukaryotic genes.Transcription in Bacteria Initiation of transcription in pro-karyotes begins with the recognition of DNA sequences by RNA polymerase. First, the bacterial RNA polymerase cata-lyzes RNA synthesis through loose binding to any region in the double-stranded DNA and then through specific binding to the promoter region with the assistance of accessory pro-teins called \u03c3 factors (sigma factors). A promoter region is the DNA region upstream", "RNA (rRNA). They consist of two subunits, 30S and 50S in prokaryotes and 40S and 60S in eukaryotes. Each ribosome has three binding sites for tRNA molecules: the A, P, and E sites that cover three neighboring codons. The A site binds an incoming aminoacyl-tRNA, the P site is occupied by peptidyl-tRNA, and the E site is occupied by the empty tRNA as it is about to exit the ribosome. Recognition of an mRNA codon is accomplished by the tRNA anticodon, which binds to the codon following the rules of complementarity and antiparallel binding.

The correct amino acid has the highest affinity for the active-site pocket of its synthetase and is therefore favored over the other 19; in particular, amino acids larger than the correct one are excluded from the active site.

FACTORS AFFECTING REACTION VELOCITY Enzymes can be isolated from cells and their properties studied in a test tube (that is, in vitro). Different enzymes show different responses to changes in substrate concentration, temperature, and pH. This section describes factors that influence the reaction velocity of enzymes. Enzymic responses to these factors give us valuable clues as to how enzymes function in living cells (that is, in vivo). A. Substrate concentration 1. Maximal velocity: The rate or velocity of a reaction (v) is the number of substrate molecules converted to product per unit", "number of substrate molecules having sufficient energy to pass over the energy barrier and form the products of the reaction. 2. Velocity decrease with higher temperature: Further elevation of the temperature causes a decrease in reaction velocity as a result of temperature-induced denaturation of the enzyme (see Fig. 5.7). The optimum temperature for most human enzymes is between 35\u00b0C and 40\u00b0C. Human enzymes start to denature (see p. 20) at temperatures above 40\u00b0C, but thermophilic bacteria found in hot springs have optimum temperatures of 70\u00b0C. C. pH 1. pH effect on active site ionization: The concentration of protons ([H+]) affects reaction velocity in several ways. First, the catalytic process usually requires that the enzyme and substrate have specific chemical groups in either an ionized or unionized state in", "known: some are capable of speeding up reactions by factors of 1014 or more. Enzymes thereby allow reactions that would not otherwise occur to proceed rapidly at normal temperatures. An enzyme cannot change the equilibrium point for a reaction. The reason is simple: when an enzyme (or any catalyst) lowers the activation energy for the reaction Y \u2192 X, of necessity it also lowers the activation energy for the reaction X \u2192 Y by exactly the same amount (see Figure 2\u201321). The forward and backward reactions will therefore be accelerated by the same factor by an enzyme, and the equilibrium point for the reaction will be unchanged (Figure 2\u201323). Thus no matter how much an enzyme speeds up a reaction, it cannot change its direction. Despite the above", "of protons ([H+]) affects reaction velocity in several ways. First, the catalytic process usually requires that the enzyme and substrate have specific chemical groups in either an ionized or unionized state in order to interact. For example, catalytic activity may require that an amino group of the enzyme be in the protonated form (\u2212NH3+). Because this group is deprotonated at alkaline pH, the rate of the reaction declines. 2. pH effect on enzyme denaturation: Extremes of pH can also lead to denaturation of the enzyme, because the structure of the catalytically active protein molecule depends on the ionic character of the amino acid side chains. 3. Variable pH optimum: The pH at which maximal enzyme activity is achieved is different for different enzymes and often reflects the [H+]", "the ionic character of the amino acid side chains. 3. Variable pH optimum: The pH at which maximal enzyme activity is achieved is different for different enzymes and often reflects the [H+] at which the enzyme functions in the body. For example, pepsin, a digestive enzyme in the stomach, is maximally active at pH 2, whereas other enzymes, designed to work at neutral pH, are denatured by such an acidic environment (Fig. 5.8). VI. MICHAELIS-MENTEN KINETICS Leonor Michaelis and Maude Menten proposed a simple model that accounts for most of the features of many enzyme-catalyzed reactions. In this model, the enzyme reversibly combines with its substrate to form an ES complex that subsequently yields product, regenerating the free enzyme.

CHAPTER SUMMARY Enzymes are protein catalysts that increase the velocity of a chemical reaction by lowering the energy of the transition state (Fig. 5.23). They are not consumed during the reaction. Enzyme molecules contain a special cleft called the active site, which contains amino acid side chains that participate in substrate binding and catalysis. The active site binds the substrate, forming an enzyme\u2013substrate (ES) complex. Binding is thought to cause a conformational change in the enzyme (induced fit) that allows catalysis. ES is converted to enzyme and product. An enzyme allows a reaction to proceed rapidly under conditions prevailing in the cell by providing an alternate reaction pathway with a lower activation energy (Ea).

The specificity and yield in amplifying a particular DNA frag-ment by PCR reaction are affected by the proper setting of the reaction parameters (e.g., enzyme, primer, and Mg2+ concen-tration, as well as the temperature cycling profile). Modifying various PCR parameters to optimize the specificity of amplifi-cation yields more homogenous products, even in rare template reactions.The emergence of the PCR technique has dramatically altered the approach to both fundamental and applied bio-logic problems.

One of these pumps may have used the energy available from ATP hydrolysis to eject H+ from the cell; such a proton pump could have been the ancestor of present-day ATP synthases. As the Earth\u2019s supply of geochemically produced nutrients began to dwindle, organisms that could find a way to pump H+ without consuming ATP would have been at an advantage: they could save the small amounts of ATP they derived from the fermentation of increasingly scarce foodstuffs to fuel other important activities.

The Nature of Primary Metabolic Myopathies The chemical energy for muscle contraction is provided by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP); ATP is restored by phosphocreatine and ADP acting in combination. These reactions are particularly important during brief, high-intensity exercise. During periods of prolonged muscle activity, rephosphorylation requires the availability of carbohydrates, fatty acids, and ketones, which are catabolized in mitochondria. Glycogen is the main sarcoplasmic source of carbohydrate, but blood glucose also moves freely in and out of muscle cells as needed during sustained exercise. The fatty acids in the blood, derived mainly from adipose tissue and intracellular lipid stores, constitute the other major source of energy. Carbohydrate is metabolized during aerobic and", "that the fatigue is caused by depletion of the creatine phosphate store. Because the creatine phosphokinase\u2013catalyzed reaction is reversible, the muscle cell replenishes the creatine phosphate pool during recovery from fatigue by using ATP synthesized through oxidative phosphorylation. Muscle cells contain glycogen, which can be metabolized during muscle contraction to provide glucose for oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis, both of which generate ATP to replenish the ATP store. Muscle cells can also take up glucose from blood, a process that is stimulated by insulin (see Chapter 39). The cytosolic enzyme phosphory lase releases glucose 1-phosphate residues from glycogen, which are then metabolized by a combination of glycolysis (in the cytosol) and oxidative phosphorylation (in the mitochondria) to yield the equivalent of 37 mol of ATP per mole of glucose", "Energy Production by Oxidative Metabolism.

This decay represents the rapid and almost total failure of the fast motor units. The decline in force/stress is paralleled by depletion of glycogen and creatine phosphate stores and the accumulation of lactic acid. Of importance is that the decline in force/ stress occurs when the ATP pool is not greatly reduced, so that the muscle fibers do not go into rigor. In contrast, the slow motor units are able to meet the energy demands of fibers under this condition, and they do not exhibit significant fatigue, even after many hours. Evidently, some factor associated with energy metabolism can inhibit", "the lactate generated by glycolysis. The increased cardiac and respiratory work during recovery also contributes to the increased oxygen consumption seen at this time and explains why more oxygen has to be \u201crepaid\u201d than was \u201cborrowed.\u201d Some oxygen debt occurs even with low levels of exercise because slow oxidative motor units consume considerable ATP, derived from creatine phosphate or glycolysis, before oxidative metabolism can increase ATP production to meet steady-state requirements. The oxygen debt is much greater with strenuous exercise, when fast glycolytic motor units are used (Fig. 12.18 ). The oxygen debt is approximately equal to the energy consumed during exercise minus that supplied by oxidative metabolism (i.e., the darkand light-colored areas in Fig. 12.18 are approximately equal). As indicated earlier, the additional oxygen used during recovery", "is present in the myoplasm, a small amount is located in the thick filament (near the M line). The creatine phosphokinase in the thick filament may participate in the rapid resynthesis of ATP near the myosin heads during muscle contraction. The phosphate store created, however, is only about five times the size of the ATP store and thus cannot support prolonged periods of contraction (less than a minute of maximal muscle activity). Skeletal muscle fatigue during intense exercise is associated with depletion of the creatine phosphate store, although as described subsequently, this does not necessarily imply that the fatigue is caused by depletion of the creatine phosphate store. Because the creatine phosphokinase\u2013catalyzed reaction is reversible, the muscle cell replenishes the creatine phosphate pool during recovery from fatigue by", "although the accumulation of various metabolic products (lactate, Pi, ADP) has been implicated. In view of the importance of preventing depletion of myoplasmic ATP, which would affect the viability of the cell, it is likely that multiple mechanisms may have been developed to induce fatigue and hence lower the rate of ATP hydrolysis before the individual risks injury or death of the skeletal muscle cell. 11. When the energy demands of an exercising muscle cannot be met by oxidative metabolism, an oxygen debt is incurred. Increased breathing during the recovery period after exercise reflects this oxygen debt. The greater the reliance on anaerobic metabolism to meet the energy requirements of muscle contraction, the greater the oxygen debt. Gordon AM, Homsher E, Regnier M. Regulation of contraction in striated", "increase in force of cardiac contraction as sarcomere length increases from 2.0um to 2.3 um, as this region is thought to represent a region of optimal overlap of myofilaments (and represents a plateau in the length tension relationship in skeletal muscle). The mechanism(s) contributing to the stretch-induced increase in Ca++ sensitivity of cardiac contraction are not clear, but appears to involve the intracellular elastic protein titin, as well as regulatory proteins (e.g., troponinC). As in skeletal muscle, myosin uses the energy in ATP to generate force, so the ATP pool, which is small, must be continually replenished. Typically, this replenishment of ATP pools is accomplished by aerobic metabolism, including the oxidation of fats and carbohydrates. During times of ischemia, the creatine phosphate pool, which converts ADP to ATP,", "the heart preferentially uses the substrate that is available in the largest concentration. The oxidation of amino acids makes a small contribution to myocardial energy expenditure. Normally, the heart derives its energy by oxidative phosphorylation, in which each mole of glucose yields 36 mol of ATP. However, during hypoxia, glycolysis takes over, and 2 mol of ATP is provided by each mole of glucose; \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids is also curtailed. If hypoxia is prolonged, cellular creatine phosphate and eventually ATP are depleted. In ischemia, lactic acid accumulates and decreases intracellular pH.

These receptors are the carotid and aortic bodies located at the bifurcation of the", "and the baroreceptors and chemoreceptors play key roles in regulating the cardiovascular system. Control of fluid balance by the kidneys, with maintenance of a constant blood volume, is also very important. In any well-regulated system, one way to evaluate the extent and sensitivity of its regulatory mechanisms is to disturb the system and to observe how it restores the preexisting steady state. Two such disturbances, physical exercise and hemorrhage, are discussed in the following sections to illustrate operation of the various regulatory factors. The cardiovascular adjustments that occur during exercise consist of a combination of neural and local (chemical) factors. Neural factors include (1) central command, (2) reflexes that originate in the contracting muscle, and (3) the baroreceptor reflex. Central command is the cerebrocortical activation of the sympathetic", "mesenteric (splanchnic) vascular beds, heart rate, and stroke volume of the heart. Together, these actions serve to maintain normal blood pressure and allow reflex maintenance of blood pressure with changes in body position. Two types of baroreceptors function as the afferent component of this reflex arc by sensing pressure gradients across the walls of large blood vessels. Those in the carotid sinus and aortic arch are sensitive to reductions in pulse pressure (the difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure), while those in the right heart chambers and pulmonary vessels respond more to alterations in blood volume. The carotid sinus baroreceptors are rapidly responsive and capable of detecting beat-to-beat changes, in contrast to the aortic arch nerves, which have a longer response time and discriminate only the larger", "decrease in systemic arterial pressure than it does at a normal level of blood pressure. Thus the set point of the baroreceptors is raised in hypertension in such a way that the threshold is increased and the pressure receptors are less sensitive to changes in transmural pressure. As would be expected, denervation of the carotid sinus can produce temporary and, in some instances, prolonged hypertension. The arterial baroreceptors play a key role in short-term adjustments in blood pressure in response to relatively abrupt changes in blood volume, cardiac output, or peripheral resistance (as in exercise). However, long-term control of blood pressure\u2014over a period of days or weeks\u2014is determined by the fluid balance of the individual: namely, the balance between fluid intake and fluid output. By far, the most", "blood flow leads to hypoxia in the chemoreceptor tissue. Chemoreceptor excitation may then enhance the already existent peripheral vasoconstriction evoked by the baroreceptor reflexes. In addition, respiratory stimulation assists venous return by the auxiliary pumping mechanism described earlier (see also When arterial pressure falls below approximately 40 mm Hg as a consequence of blood loss, the resulting cerebral ischemia activates the sympathoadrenal system. The discharge by sympathetic nerves is several times greater than the maximal neural activity that occurs when the baroreceptors cease to be stimulated. The vasoconstriction and increase in myocardial contractility may be pronounced. With more severe degrees of cerebral ischemia, however, the vagal centers also become activated. The resulting bradycardia aggravates the hypotension that initiated the cerebral ischemia Reabsorption of Tissue Fluids The arterial hypotension,", "established by measuring the blood pressure in the supine and then in the standing position and noting a substantial drop accompanied by symptoms of dizziness or syncope. It should be emphasized that the bedside testing of orthostatic blood pressure is best performed by having the patient stand quickly and taking readings immediately and again at 1 min and at 3 min, rather than using the lying-sitting-standing sequence. Orthostatic hypotension involves the failure to maintain blood pressure in the upright posture. The maintenance of blood pressure during various levels of activity and with postural changes depends on pressure-sensitive receptors (baroreceptors) in the aortic arch and carotid sinus and mechanoreceptors in the walls of the heart.

Several cardiovascular responses are thus evoked, all of which tend to restore arterial pressure to the normal level. Such responses include reduction of vagal tone and enhancement of sympathetic tone, increased heart rate, and enhanced myocardial contractility. The increased sympathetic tone also produces generalized venoconstriction, which has the same hemodynamic consequences as transfusion of blood (see Fig. 19.9). Sym pathetic activation constricts certain blood reservoirs. This vasoconstriction acts as an autotransfusion of blood into the circulation. In", "greatest in the femoral vessels, less in the renal vessels, and least in the mesenteric and celiac vessels. In addition, the sensitivity of the carotid sinus reflex can be altered. Local application of norepinephrine or stimulation of sympathetic nerve fibers to the carotid sinuses enhances the sensitivity of its receptors in such a way that a given increase in intrasinus pressure produces a greater depressor response.

A living cell is a dynamic chemical system, operating far from chemical equilibrium. For a cell to grow or to make a new cell in its own image, it must take in free energy from the environment, as well as raw materials, to drive the necessary synthetic reactions. This consumption of free energy is fundamental to life. When it stops, a cell decays toward chemical equilibrium and soon dies. Genetic information is also fundamental to life, and free energy is required for the propagation of this information. For example, to specify one bit of", "bodies function, we must attain a deep understanding of proteins. From a chemical point of view, proteins are by far the most structurally complex and functionally sophisticated molecules known. This is perhaps not surprising, once we realize that the structure and chemistry of each protein has been developed and fine-tuned over billions of years of evolutionary history. The theoretical calculations of population geneticists reveal that, over evolutionary time periods, a surprisingly small selective advantage is enough to cause a randomly altered protein sequence to spread through a population of organisms. Yet, even to experts, the remarkable versatility of proteins can seem truly amazing. In this section, we consider how the location of each amino acid in the long string of amino acids that forms a protein determines its", "a standard way to any other amino acid in the set; attached to this core is a side group that gives each amino acid a distinctive chemical character. Each of the protein molecules is a polypeptide, created by joining its amino acids in a particular sequence. Through billions of years of evolution, this sequence has been selected to give the protein a useful function. Thus, by folding into a precise three-dimensional form with reactive sites on its surface (Figure 1\u20137A), these amino-acid polymers can bind with high specificity to other molecules and can act as enzymes to catalyze reactions that make or break covalent bonds. In this way they direct the vast majority of chemical processes in the cell (Figure 1\u20137B).

Mutant bacteria with a specific alteration in the small ribosomal subunit have longer delays and translate mRNA into protein with an accuracy considerably higher than this; however, protein synthesis is so slow in these mutants that the bacteria are barely able to survive. We have also seen that attaining the observed accuracy of protein synthesis requires the expenditure of a great deal of free energy; this is expected, since, as discussed in Chapter 2, there is a price to be paid for any increase in order in the cell.

The correct amino acid has the highest affinity for the active-site pocket of its synthetase and is therefore favored over the other 19; in particular, amino acids larger than the correct one are excluded from the active site.

Azotemia may result from reduced renal perfusion, intrinsic renal disease, or postrenal processes (ureteral obstruction; see below and Fig. 61-1). Precise determination of GFR is problematic, as both commonly measured indices (urea and creatinine) have characteristics that affect their accuracy as markers of clearance. Urea clearance may underestimate GFR significantly because of urea reabsorption by the tubule. In contrast, creatinine is derived from muscle metabolism of creatine, and its generation varies little from day to day. Creatinine clearance (CrCl), an approximation of GFR, is measured from plasma and urinary creatinine excretion rates for a defined period (usually 24 h) and is expressed in milliliters per minute: CrCl = (Uvol \u00d7 UCr)/(PCr \u00d7 Tmin).

The decreased availability of hepatic ATP decreases gluconeogenesis (causing hypoglycemia with vomiting) and protein synthesis (causing a decrease in blood-clotting factors and other essential proteins). Renal reabsorption of Pi is also decreased. [Note: The drop in Pi also inhibits glycogenolysis (see p. 128).] Diagnosis of HFI can be made on the basis of fructose in the urine, enzyme assay using liver cells, or by DNA-based testing (see Chapter 34).

During periods of prolonged muscle activity, rephosphorylation requires the availability of carbohydrates, fatty acids, and ketones, which are catabolized in mitochondria. Glycogen is the main sarcoplasmic source of carbohydrate, but blood glucose also moves freely in and out of muscle cells as needed during sustained exercise.

This decay represents the rapid and almost total failure of the fast motor units. The decline in force/stress is paralleled by depletion of glycogen and creatine phosphate stores and the accumulation of lactic acid. Of importance is that the decline in force/ stress occurs when the ATP pool is not greatly reduced, so that the muscle fibers do not go into rigor.

A regular program of isotonic exercise that is within the limits of the individual patient\u2019s threshold for the development of angina pectoris and that does not exceed 80% of the heart rate associated with ischemia on exercise testing should be strongly encouraged. Based on the results of an exercise test, the number of metabolic equivalent tasks (METs) performed at the onset of ischemia can be estimated (Table 293-2) and a practical exercise prescription can be formulated to permit daily activities that will fall below the ischemic threshold (Table 293-3).

To obtain the maximum benefit, the calorie to protein ratio must be adequate (at least 100 to 150 kcal/g nitrogen), and both carbohydrates and proteins must be infused simultaneously. When the sources of calories and nitrogen are given at different times, there is a significant decrease in nitrogen utilization. These nutrients can be given in quantities considerably greater than the", "(the salt solution). This is achieved by augmenting the solution in the tube with a shallow gradient of sucrose prepared by a special mixing device. The resulting density gradient\u2014with the dense end at the bottom of the tube\u2014keeps each region of the solution denser than any solution above it, and it thereby prevents convective mixing from distorting the separation.

A finer degree of separation can be achieved by layering the homogenate in a thin band on top of a salt solution that fills a centrifuge tube. When centrifuged, the various components in the mixture move as a series of distinct bands through the solution, each at a different rate, in a process called velocity sedimentation (Figure 8\u20137A). For the procedure to work effectively, the bands must be protected from convective mixing, which would normally occur whenever a denser solution (for example, one containing organelles) finds itself on top of a lighter one (the salt solution).

OVERVIEW Obesity is a disorder of body weight regulatory systems characterized by an accumulation of excess body fat. In primitive societies, in which daily life required a high level of physical activity and food was only available intermittently, a genetic tendency favoring storage of excess calories as fat may have had a survival value. Today, however, the sedentary lifestyle and abundance and wide variety of palatable, inexpensive foods in industrialized societies has undoubtedly contributed to an obesity epidemic. As adiposity has", "Board considers to be healthful. These ranges are 10\u201335% of calories for protein, 20\u201335% of calories for fat, and 45\u201365% of calories for carbohydrate. Alcohol, which also provides energy, is not a nutrient; therefore, no recommendations are not provided. The DRIs are affected by age, sex, rate of growth, pregnancy, lactation, physical activity level, concomitant diseases, drugs, and dietary composition. If requirements for nutrient sufficiency are close to levels indicating excess of a nutrient, dietary planning is difficult. Physiologic Factors Growth, strenuous physical activity, pregnancy, and lactation all increase needs for energy and several essential nutrients. Energy needs rise during pregnancy due to the demands of fetal growth and during lactation because of the increased energy required for milk production. Energy needs decrease with loss of lean body", "3 fatty acids per week; decreasing sodium intake to <2300 mg/d; consuming 3 cups of milk (or equivalent low-fat or fat-free dairy products) per day; limiting cholesterol intake to <300 mg/d; and keeping total fat intake at 20\u201335% of daily calories and saturated fat intake at <10% of daily calories. Application of these guidelines to specific calorie goals can be found on the website www.choosemyplate.gov. The revised Dietary Reference Intakes for Macronutrients released by the Institute of Medicine recommends that 45\u201365% of calories come from carbohydrates, 20\u201335% from fat, and 10\u201335% from protein.

The Web version of the guide provides a calculator that tailors the number of servings suggested for healthy patients of different weights, sexes, ages, and life-cycle stages to help them to meet their needs while avoiding excess (http://www.supertracker.usda.gov/default.aspx and www .ChooseMyPlate.gov).

Their high levels of mitochondrial oxidative enzymes are demonstrated by their strong succinic dehydrogenase and NADH-TR histochemical staining reactions as described previously (see Fig. 11.3).

These fibers have great resistance to fatigue but generate less tension than other fibers. Their myosin ATPase reaction velocity is the slowest of all of the fiber types. Type", "muscle, also helps slow muscle resist fatigue. Fast muscle, in contrast, is recruited for activities that require faster movements, more force, or both (see Fig. 12.15 ). Weightlifting, for example, can require a lot of power for short duration. In order to meet the demands for more force, additional motor units are recruited. In comparison with slow motor units, the fast motor units typically contain more muscle fibers (see Table 12.2 ). Fast muscle fibers also have a larger diameter than do slow muscle fibers. Thus recruitment of fast motor units can help meet the increased demands of burst activities such as weightlifting.

The increase in force during tetanic contractions is due to prolonged elevation of intracellular [Ca++]. 5. The two basic types of skeletal muscle fibers are distinguished on the basis of their speed of contraction (i.e., fast-twitch versus slow-twitch). The difference in speed of contraction is attributed to the expression of different myosin isoforms that differ in myosin ATPase activity. In addition to the difference in myosin ATPase activity, fast-and slow-twitch muscles also differ in metabolic activity, fiber diameter, motor unit size, sensitivity to tetany, and recruitment pattern. 6. Typically, slow-twitch muscles are recruited before fast-twitch muscle fibers because of the greater excitability of motor neurons innervating slow-twitch muscles.

They also fatigue rapidly as a result of production of lactic acid. Thus, type IIb fibers are adapted for rapid contraction and precise, fine movements.

The high myosin ATPase activity in fast muscle fibers and the increase in diffusion distance (resulting from the large diameter of the fast muscle fibers), however, increase the susceptibility of fast muscle fibers to fatigue. Additional differences between fast and slow muscles include the following: 1. The motor neuron in slow muscle is more easily excited than that in fast muscle, and so slow muscles are typically recruited first. As stated previously, the high oxidative capacity of slow muscle, coupled with the low myosin ATPase activity, helps reduce the susceptibility to fatigue in slow muscle. 2.

A number of other factors, including glycogen depletion from a specialized compartment, a localized increase in [ADP], extracellular elevation of [K+], and generation of oxygen free radicals, have also been implicated in various forms of exercise-induced muscle fatigue. Finally, the central nervous system contributes to fatigue, especially in how fatigue is perceived by the individual. Regardless of whether the muscle is fatigued as a consequence of high-intensity exercise or prolonged exercise, the myoplasmic ATP level does not decrease substantially. In view of the reliance of all cells on the availability of ATP to maintain viability, fatigue has", "reducing the excitatory input. Excitatory input can be reduced by sectioning the appropriate spinal or dorsal root or by severing the tendon, which functionally inactivates peripheral mechanoreceptors. The frequency of contraction determines fiber development and phenotype through changes in gene expression and protein synthesis.

Therefore, during intense exercise, lactate accumulates in muscle, causing a drop in the intracellular pH, potentially resulting in cramps. Much of this lactate eventually diffuses into the bloodstream and can be used by the liver to make glucose (see p. 118). 2. Lactate utilization: The direction of the LDH reaction depends on the relative intracellular concentrations of pyruvate and lactate and on the ratio of NADH/NAD+. For example, in the liver and heart, this ratio is lower than in exercising muscle. Consequently, the liver and heart oxidize lactate (obtained from the blood) to pyruvate. In the liver, pyruvate is", "example, the addition of lactate to the blood that perfuses a heart metabolizing glucose leads to a reduction in glucose uptake and vice versa. At normal blood concentrations, glucose and lactate are consumed at approximately equal rates. In contrast, uptake of pyruvate is very low, as is its arterial concentration. For glucose, the threshold concentration is approximately 4 mmol/L. Below this blood level, no glucose is taken up by the myocardium. Insulin reduces the glucose threshold and increases the rate of glucose uptake by the heart. Cardiac utilization of lactate occurs in most circumstances; insulin does not affect its uptake by the myocardium.

The oxygen debt is much greater with strenuous exercise, when fast glycolytic motor units are used (Fig. 12.18 ).

Thus the rate of myocardial O2 consumption is tightly linked to the work rate (or power) of the myocardium. The heart is versatile in its use of substrates, and within certain limits, uptake of a particular substrate is directly proportional to its arterial concentration. The use of one substrate by the heart is also influenced by the presence or absence of other substrates.

When the energy demands of an exercising muscle cannot be met by oxidative metabolism, an oxygen debt is incurred.

During normal oxygenation (aerobic metabolism), glucose is converted to pyruvate, which enters the Krebs cycle; with anaerobic metabolism, lactate is formed.

ENZYME REGULATION The regulation of the reaction velocity of enzymes is essential if an organism is to coordinate its numerous metabolic processes. The rates of most enzymes are responsive to changes in substrate concentration, because the intracellular level of many substrates is in the range of the Km. Thus, an increase in substrate concentration prompts an increase in reaction rate, which tends to return the concentration of substrate toward normal. In addition, some enzymes with specialized regulatory functions respond to allosteric effectors and/or covalent modification or they show altered rates of enzyme synthesis (or degradation) when physiologic conditions are changed. A. Allosteric enzymes Allosteric enzymes are regulated by molecules called effectors that bind noncovalently at a site other than the active site.

CHAPTER SUMMARY Enzymes are protein catalysts that increase the velocity of a chemical reaction by lowering the energy of the transition state (Fig. 5.23). They are not consumed during the reaction. Enzyme molecules contain a special cleft called the active site, which contains amino acid side chains that participate in substrate binding and catalysis. The active site binds the substrate, forming an enzyme\u2013substrate (ES) complex. Binding is thought to cause a conformational change in the enzyme (induced fit) that allows catalysis. ES is converted to enzyme and product. An enzyme allows a reaction to proceed rapidly under conditions prevailing in the cell by providing an alternate reaction pathway with a lower activation energy (Ea). Because the", "a standard way to any other amino acid in the set; attached to this core is a side group that gives each amino acid a distinctive chemical character. Each of the protein molecules is a polypeptide, created by joining its amino acids in a particular sequence. Through billions of years of evolution, this sequence has been selected to give the protein a useful function. Thus, by folding into a precise three-dimensional form with reactive sites on its surface (Figure 1\u20137A), these amino-acid polymers can bind with high specificity to other molecules and can act as enzymes to catalyze reactions that make or break covalent bonds. In this way they direct the vast majority of chemical processes in the cell (Figure 1\u20137B).

But in addition, more powerful ways of analyzing networks will be needed based on mathematical and computational tools not yet invented, as we shall emphasize in Chapter 8. Clearly, there are many wonderful challenges that remain for future generations of cell biologists. Proteins can form enormously sophisticated chemical devices, whose functions largely depend on the detailed chemical properties of their surfaces. Binding sites for ligands are formed as surface cavities in which precisely positioned amino acid side chains are brought together by protein folding. In this way, normally unreactive amino acid side chains can be activated to make and break covalent bonds.

Grouping them into syndromes based on their temporal and topographic features has proved to be of great value in clinical diagnosis. Although motor, sensory, reflex, and trophic changes are taken together to determine specific diagnosis, each element of the neuropathic diseases is given in the following pages. Impairment of Motor Function It is not surprising that weakness in various patterns and degrees is a feature of almost all neuropathies. The degree of weakness is proportional to the number of axons or motor neurons affected. Polyneuropathies that are the result of axonal damage are characterized foremost by a relatively symmetric distribution of weakness that is, moreover, distal because the pathologic changes begin in", "the peripheral nerves, weakness is relatively symmetrical from the beginning and progresses bilaterally; reflexes are lost in affected parts but particularly at the ankles; sensory complaints and loss of sensation are most pronounced distally, and in the feet before the hands in most cases. Polyradiculopathy, a disease of multiple spinal roots, differs from polyneuropathy in that the neurologic signs are asymmetrical, with an erratic distribution that may, for example, be proximal in one limb and distal in another. Weakness and zones of sensory loss correspond to involvement of one or more spinal or cranial roots. Pain in the sensory distribution of the roots is a common feature. The common single radiculopathy, most often the result of root compression by disease of the spinal column, is identified by pain,", "further on. The distal, symmetrical, primarily sensory form of polyneuropathy is the most common type. It is usually a chronic process, sometimes unnoticed by the patient. The main complaints are persistent and often distressing numbness and tingling, usually confined to the feet and lower legs and worse at night. The ankle jerks are absent and, sometimes, the patellar reflexes as well. As a rule, sensory loss is confined to the distal parts of the lower extremities, but in severe cases the hands are involved and the sensory loss may even spread to the anterior trunk, simulating a sensory level of spinal cord disease (Said et al, 1983). Trophic changes in the form of deep ulcerations and neuropathic degeneration of the joints (Charcot joints) are encountered in the most", "bottle. Eventually the nerves to the calf muscles degenerate and the ability to plantar flex the feet is lost. After a period of many years, atrophy of the hand and forearm muscles develops in some cases. The hands later become clawed. The wasting seldom extends above the elbows or above the middle third of the thighs. Paresthesias and cramps are present but only to a slight degree and there is always some impairment, usually also mild, of deep and superficial sensation in the feet and hands, shading off proximally. Rarely, the sensory loss is severe and perforating ulcers appear as they do in the pure sensory varieties of inherited neuropathy. The tendon reflexes are absent in the involved limbs. The illness progresses very slowly over decades, giving the", "columns of the spinal cord. The symptoms generally appear over hours or days, at times being so trifling that they are ignored, and other times coming on so acutely and prominently as to bring the patient urgently to the doctor. The resulting clinical syndromes vary from a mere dragging or poor control of one or both legs to a spastic or ataxic paraparesis. The tendon reflexes are retained and later become hyperactive with extensor plantar reflexes; varying degrees of deep and superficial sensory loss may be associated. It is a useful adage that the patient with MS often presents with symptoms in one leg but with signs in both; the patient will complain of weakness, incoordination, or numbness and tingling in one lower limb and prove to have", "over the extremities, and to determine whether the findings are the same in symmetrical parts of the body. A rough survey of this sort occasionally detects sensory defects of which the patient was unaware. More thorough testing is in order if the patient has complaints referable to the sensory system or if one finds localized atrophy or weakness, ataxia, trophic changes of joints, or painless ulcers. A few other general rules are useful. It is easier for a patient to perceive the boundary of an abnormal area of sensation if the examiner proceeds from an area of reduced sensation toward the normal area. One should not press the sensory examination in the presence of fatigue, for an inattentive patient is a poor witness. Also, the examiner must avoid", "which reason we have on occasion asked a neurosurgeon to remove a midlumbar (L2 or L3) motor rootlet for examination. Also particularly difficult diagnostically is a polyradiculopathy that involves the motor roots exclusively or predominantly and is indistinguishable from motor neuron disease except for the absence of widespread denervation or of progressive upper motor neuron signs and differing from the immune motor neuropathies discussed further on by the absence of conduction block. In these common syndromes, reduced sensation, weakness, muscular atrophy, and loss of tendon reflexes progress over a period of months or years. Within this large category, two groups are distinguished. In the first and less chronic of the two, the neuropathy appears over months or a year or two. Comprising this group are acquired processes such", "In the advanced stages of Parkinson disease, falling of a similar type may be a serious problem, but it is more surprising how relatively infrequently it occurs. The cause of the toppling phenomenon is unclear; it does not have its basis in weakness, ataxia, or loss of deep sensation. It appears to be a disorder of balance that is occasioned by precipitant action or the wrong placement of a foot and by a failure of the righting reflexes. Slowness of motor response is another factor. Sensory (Tabetic, or Proprioceptive) Gait Ataxia A loss of proprioception\u2014as occurs in patients with severe large-fiber polyneuropathy, posterior nerve root lesions (e.g., tabes dorsalis, lumbosacral root compression), or interruption of the posterior columns in the spinal cord (multiple sclerosis, vitamin B12 deficiency, spondylotic,", "may believe that only one leg is affected, it is commonly found that both plantar reflexes are extensor, the one on the side of the stiffer leg being more clearly so. Less often, both legs are equally affected. As the compression continues, walking becomes unsteady because of the addition of sensory ataxia. The biceps and brachioradial reflexes on one or both sides may be depressed, sometimes in association with an increase in the triceps and finger reflexes. The hand or forearm muscles may undergo atrophy; in a few cases, the atrophy of hand muscles is severe. In such cases, the spondylotic compression, as judged by MRI or CT myelography, may be confined to the high cervical cord, well above the levels of the motor neurons that innervate these", "diphtheria, tick paralysis, and basilar artery occlusion. Bilateral but asymmetrical facial and abducens weakness coupled with distal paresthesias or with proximal leg weakness is one of several other variants in our experience (Ropper, 1994). The tendon reflexes may be absent only at the ankles or at the knees. Lyme disease and sarcoidosis are then considerations in diagnosis. Whether bifacial palsy alone represents a variant of GBS is uncertain, but almost every case in our experience has had an alternative explanation. Paraparetic, ataxic, and purely motor or purely sensory forms of the illness have also been observed. Less difficulty attends the correct diagnosis of GBS if paresthesias in the acral extremities, progressive reduction or loss of reflexes, and relative symmetry of weakness appear after several days.

Psychogenic tremors are usually restricted to a single limb, often in the dominant hand; they are gross in nature and are less regular than the common static or action tremors.

These movement disorders are involuntary and cannot be inhibited, thereby differing from habit spasms or tics. At one time, torticollis was thought to be a psychological disorder but all now agree that it is a localized form of dystonia. It is characteristic of focal dystonias to display a simultaneous activation of agonist and antagonist muscles (co-contraction) and to have a tendency for the spasm to spread to adjacent muscle groups that are not normally activated in the movement (overflow), but these features tend not to be as prominent in focal dystonias as in the generalized varieties described earlier. Sometimes, focal dystonias include an arrhythmic intermixed", "opposed to tremor that is apparent in a position of rest or repose. Action tremors can be roughly divided into two categories: goal directed action tremor of the ataxic type related to cerebellar disorders (discussed in Chap. 5) and postural tremors, which are either the enhanced physiologic variety or essential tremor (Fig. 4-6). A postural tremor occurs with the limbs and trunk actively maintained in certain positions (such as holding the arms outstretched) and may persist throughout active movement. More particularly, the tremor is absent when the limbs are relaxed but becomes evident when the muscles are activated. The tremor is accentuated as greater precision of movement is demanded, but it does not approach the degree of augmentation seen with cerebellar intention tremor. Most cases of action tremor", "it is impossible to distinguish between them, hence the term choreoathetosis. An apt description could be of a moving dystonia (see below). Discrete voluntary movements of the hand are executed more slowly than normal, and attempts to perform them may result in a co-contraction of antagonistic muscles and a spread (overflow) of contraction to muscles not normally required in the movement. The overflow appears related to a failure of the striatum to suppress the activity of unwanted muscle groups. Some forms of athetosis occur only during the performance of projected movement (intention or action athetosis). Athetosis may affect all four limbs or may be unilateral, especially in children who have suffered a hemiplegia at an early time in life (posthemiplegic athetosis). Many athetotic patients with destructive focal brain", "them as noted further on. In most patients the spasms remain confined to the neck muscles and persist in unmodified form, but in some the spasms spread, involving muscles of the shoulder girdle and back or the face and limbs. The distinction between these patterns is not fundamental. About 15 percent of patients with torticollis also have oral, mandibular, or hand dystonia, 10 percent have blepharospasm, and a similarly small number have a family history of dystonia or tremor (Chan et al). As already noted, no neuropathologic changes have been found in case studies, for example, those reported by Tarlov and by Zweig and colleagues.

In adults, high-dose anticholinergic treatment is less successful but worthy of a trial. Clonazepam is beneficial in some patients with segmental myoclonus.

Because many patients are reluctant to complain, this practice leads to needless suffering. In the absence of sedation at the expected time of peak effect, a physician should not hesitate to repeat the initial dose to achieve satisfactory pain relief.

The abnormal sensations coexist in many cases with a sensory deficit and local autonomic dysfunction. Furthermore, chronic pain of neuropathic injury generally responds less well to treatment in comparison to acute pain. The following are the main types of neurogenic pain. Pain states of peripheral nerve origin, for which the term neuropathic is more strictly applicable, far outnumber those caused by spinal cord, brainstem, thalamic, and cerebral disease.

Although the pain is localized to a sensory territory supplied by a nerve, plexus or nerve root, it often radiates to adjacent areas. Sometimes the onset of pain acuity follows an injury; more often it appears at some point during the evolution or recession of the disorder. The disease of the nerve may be obvious, expressed by the usual sensory, motor, reflex, and autonomic changes, or these changes may be undetectable by standard tests. In the latter case, the term neuralgia is used. The postulated mechanisms of peripheral nerve pain are diverse and differ from those of central diseases.

The final pathway of activation of sensory nerves consists of opening of the various channels that are expressed on the surface of sensory endings and axons, as detailed in an earlier section. Perception of Pain The threshold for perception of pain, that is, the lowest intensity of a stimulus recognized as pain, is approximately the same in all persons. Inflammation lowers the threshold for perception of pain by a process called sensitization. The pain threshold is, of course, raised by local anesthetics, centrally acting analgesic drugs, and by certain lesions of the nervous system. Mechanisms other than lowering or raising the pain threshold are important as well. Placebos reduce pain in about one-third of patients in which such effects", "rise to pain but probably not to other sensations. Blood vessels are a source of pain when pierced by a needle or involved in an inflammatory process. Distention of arteries or veins, as occurs with thrombotic or embolic occlusion, may be sources of pain; other mechanisms, operative mainly in headache, relate to traction on arteries or inflammation of the meningeal structures by which they are supported. Pain from intraneural lesions probably arises from the sheaths of the nerves. Nerve root(s) and sensory ganglia, when compressed (e.g., by a ruptured disc), give rise to pain. The special subject of headache and its origins is taken up in Chap. 9. With damage to tissue, there is a release of proteolytic enzymes, which act locally on tissue proteins to liberate substances", "of pain of unclear origin except that one generally stops short of ablative procedures that irrevocably damage nerves or parts of the central nervous system. The field of pain relief was altered by the introduction of analgesic procedures that block nerves, alter neural conduction, or administer conventional medications in new ways. In addition, a number of procedures such as intrathecal pumps and spinal cord stimulators and medications are effective for pain relief but are unique to specific situations. For example, trigeminal neuralgia may be relieved by microvascular decompression of a branch of the basilar artery or by controlled damage of the gasserian ganglion; painful dystonic disorders may be relieved by the intramuscular injection of botulinum toxin. The following discussion provides some guidance for the physician who is asked", "term neuralgia is used. The postulated mechanisms of peripheral nerve pain are diverse and differ from those of central diseases. Some of the major ideas were mentioned in the earlier section on chronic pain. One mechanism is denervation hypersensitivity, first described by Walter Cannon. He noted that when a group of neurons is deprived of its natural innervation, they become hyperactive. Others point to a reduced density of certain types of fibers in nerves supplying a causalgic zone as the basis of the burning pain but the comparison of the density of nerves from painful and nonpainful neuropathies has not proved to be consistently different. For example, Dyck and colleagues, in a study of painful versus nonpainful axonal neuropathies, concluded that there was no difference between them in", "some clinical situations these procedures have indeed given relief from pain, but not necessarily as a result of stimulation of large myelinated fibers alone (see Taub and Campbell). In a number of other instances relating to pain in largeand small-fiber neuropathies, however, the clinical behavior has been quite out of keeping with what one would expect on the basis of the gate-control mechanism. As with preceding theories, weaknesses have been exposed in the physiologic observations on which the theory is based. These and other aspects of the gate-control theory of pain have been critically reviewed by Nathan.

To explain these findings, Head postulated the existence of two systems of cutaneous receptors and conducting fibers: (1) an ancient protopathic system, subserving pain and extreme differences in temperature and yielding ungraded, diffuse impressions of an all-or-none type; and (2) a more recently evolved epicritic system, which mediated touch, two-point discrimination, and lesser differences in temperature, as well as localized pain. The pain and hyperesthesia that followed damage to a peripheral nerve were attributed to a loss of inhibition that was normally exerted by the epicritic upon the protopathic system. This theory was used for many years to explain the sensory alterations that occur with both peripheral and central (thalamic) lesions. It lost credibility for several reasons but mainly because Head\u2019s", "as the pattern or summation theory. In an effort to conciliate the specificity and pattern theories, Head and colleagues, in 1905, formulated a concept of pain sensation based on observations that followed the purposeful sectioning of the cutaneous branch of the radial nerve in his own forearm. The zone of impaired sensation contained an innermost area in which superficial sensation was completely abolished. This was surrounded by a narrower (\u201cintermediate\u201d) zone, in which pain sensation was preserved but poorly localized; extreme degrees of temperature were recognized in the intermediate zone but perception of touch, lesser differences of temperature, and two-point discrimination were abolished.

Clinical Manifestations Diagnosis is often made in asymptomatic patients because they have elevated ALP levels on routine blood chemistry testing or an abnormality on a skeletal radiograph obtained for another indication. The skeletal sites most commonly involved are the pelvis, vertebral bodies, skull, femur, and tibia. Familial cases with an early presentation often have numerous active sites of skeletal involvement. The most common presenting symptom is pain, which may result from increased bony vascularity, expanding lytic lesions, fractures, bowing, or other deformities.

Usually, several adjacent vertebrae of the thoracic spine are affected but other parts of the skeleton are also involved (see later), which facilitates diagnosis. Posterior surgical decompression leaving the pedicles intact is indicated if there is sufficient stability of the vertebral bodies to prevent collapse. Medical management includes the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for persistent pain; calcitonin to reduce pain and plasma levels of alkaline phosphatase; and cytotoxic drugs such as plicamycin and etidronate disodium to reduce bone resorption.

The Nature of Primary Metabolic Myopathies The chemical energy for muscle contraction is provided by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP); ATP is restored by phosphocreatine and ADP acting in combination. These reactions are particularly important during brief, high-intensity exercise. During periods of prolonged muscle activity, rephosphorylation requires the availability of carbohydrates, fatty acids, and ketones, which are catabolized in mitochondria. Glycogen is the main sarcoplasmic source of carbohydrate, but blood glucose also moves freely in and out of muscle cells as needed during sustained exercise. The fatty acids in the blood, derived mainly from adipose tissue and intracellular lipid stores, constitute the other major source of energy. Carbohydrate is metabolized during aerobic and", "by muscle decline rapidly, and these changes have important health and functional consequences. Balance Between Energy Availability and Energy demand Release of phosphate from ATP provides every living cell with the energy required for life. However, the storage of ATP is only enough for 6 sec; therefore, ATP is constantly resynthesized. Although ATP can be resynthesized by anaerobic glycolysis, most of the energy used in the body is generated through aerobic metabolism. Therefore, energy consumption is usually estimated indirectly by oxygen consumption (indirect calorimetry). There is currently no method to measure true \u201cfitness,\u201d which is the maximal energy that can be produced by an organism over extended periods. Thus, fitness is estimated indirectly from peak oxygen consumption (MVo ), often during a maximal treadmill test. gressively with aging", "needed during sustained exercise. The fatty acids in the blood, derived mainly from adipose tissue and intracellular lipid stores, constitute the other major source of energy. Carbohydrate is metabolized during aerobic and anaerobic phases of metabolism; the fatty acids are metabolized only aerobically. Resting muscle derives approximately 70 percent of its energy from the oxidation of long-chain fatty acids. As stated earlier, the circumstances during exercise are somewhat different. During a short period of intense exercise, the muscle uses carbohydrate derived from glycogen stores; myophosphorylase is the enzyme that initiates the metabolism of glycogen. With longer aerobic exercise, blood flow to muscle and the availability of glucose and fatty acids are increased. At first, glucose is the main source of energy during exercise; later, with exhaustion of glycogen", "fibers to endurance exercise is mainly the result of an increase in the oxidative metabolic capacity of the motor units involved. This demand places an increased load on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems and increases the capacity of the heart and respiratory muscles. The latter effects are responsible for the principal health benefits associated with endurance exercise. Muscle strength can be increased by regular massive efforts that involve most motor units. Such efforts recruit fast glycolytic motor units, as well as slow oxidative motor units. During these efforts, blood supply to the working muscles may be interrupted as tissue pressures rise above intravascular pressure. The reduced blood flow limits the duration of the contraction. Regular maximal-strength exercise, such as weightlifting, induces the synthesis of more myofibrils and hence", "glycogen, which are then metabolized by a combination of glycolysis (in the cytosol) and oxidative phosphorylation (in the mitochondria) to yield the equivalent of 37 mol of ATP per mole of glucose 1-phosphate. Blood glucose yields 36 mol of ATP per mole of glucose because 1 ATP is used to phosphorylate glucose at the start of glycolysis. These ATP yields, however, are dependent on an adequate oxygen supply. Under anaerobic conditions, in contrast, metabolism of glycogen and glucose yields only 3 and 2 mol of ATP per mole of glucose 1-phosphate and glucose, respectively (along with 2 mol of lactate). As discussed later, muscle fatigue during prolonged exercise is associated with depletion of glycogen stores in the muscle. Fatty acids represent an important source of energy for muscle", "aerobic exercise, blood flow to muscle and the availability of glucose and fatty acids are increased. At first, glucose is the main source of energy during exercise; later, with exhaustion of glycogen stores, energy is provided by oxidation of fatty acids. Thus, muscle failure at a certain phase of exercise is predictive of the type of energy failure. A rising blood concentration of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate reflects the increasing oxidation of fatty acids, and an increase in blood lactate reflects the anaerobic metabolism of glucose. The cytochrome oxidative mechanisms are essential in both aerobic and anaerobic muscle metabolism; these mechanisms are considered in Chap. 36 in relation to the mitochondrial diseases in which muscle tissue is prominently involved, and they are referred to here only briefly. It follows from these", "although the accumulation of various metabolic products (lactate, Pi, ADP) has been implicated. In view of the importance of preventing depletion of myoplasmic ATP, which would affect the viability of the cell, it is likely that multiple mechanisms may have been developed to induce fatigue and hence lower the rate of ATP hydrolysis before the individual risks injury or death of the skeletal muscle cell. 11. When the energy demands of an exercising muscle cannot be met by oxidative metabolism, an oxygen debt is incurred. Increased breathing during the recovery period after exercise reflects this oxygen debt. The greater the reliance on anaerobic metabolism to meet the energy requirements of muscle contraction, the greater the oxygen debt. Gordon AM, Homsher E, Regnier M.

This decay represents the rapid and almost total failure of the fast motor units. The decline in force/stress is paralleled by depletion of glycogen and creatine phosphate stores and the accumulation of lactic acid. Of importance is that the decline in force/ stress occurs when the ATP pool is not greatly reduced, so that the muscle fibers do not go into rigor.

The AChR consists of five subunits (2\u03b1, 1\u03b2, 1\u03b4, and 1\u03b3 or \u03b5) arranged around a central pore. When ACh combines with the binding sites on the \u03b1 subunits of the AChR, the channel in the AChR opens, permitting the rapid entry of cations, chiefly sodium, which produces depolarization at the end-plate region of the muscle fiber.

However, if the end plate potential is large, the adjacent muscle membrane is depolarized, and an action potential will be propagated along the entire muscle fiber. Muscle contraction is then initiated by excitation-contraction coupling. The released acetylcholine is quickly removed from the end plate region by both diffusion and enzymatic destruction by the local acetylcholinesterase enzyme. At least two additional types of acetylcholine receptors are found within the neuromuscular apparatus. One type is located on the presynaptic motor axon terminal, and activation of these receptors mobilizes additional transmitter for subsequent release by moving more acetylcholine vesicles toward the synaptic membrane. The second type of receptor is found on extrajunctional cells and is not normally involved in", "nicotinic blocking drugs.) When a nicotinic agonist is applied directly (by iontophoresis or by intra-arterial injection), an immediate depolarization of the end plate results, caused by an increase in permeability to sodium and potassium ions (Figure 7\u20134B). The contractile response varies from disorganized fasciculations of independent motor units to a strong contraction of the entire muscle depending on the synchronization of depolarization of end plates throughout the muscle. Depolarizing nicotinic agents that are not rapidly hydrolyzed (like nicotine itself) cause rapid development of depolarization blockade; transmission blockade persists even when the membrane has repolarized (discussed further in Chapters 8 and 27). This latter phase of block is manifested as flaccid paralysis in the case of skeletal muscle.

If the depolarization is sufficiently large, it initiates an action potential that is propagated along the muscle fiber, triggering muscle contraction. This process is rapidly terminated by hydrolysis of ACh by acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which is present within the synaptic folds, and by diffusion of ACh away from the receptor. In MG, the fundamental defect is a decrease in the number of available AChRs at the postsynaptic muscle membrane. In addition, the postsynaptic folds are flattened, or \u201csimplified.\u201d These changes result in decreased efficiency of neuromuscular transmission. Therefore, although ACh is released normally, it produces small end-plate potentials that may fail to trigger muscle action potentials. Failure of transmission at many neuromuscular junctions results in weakness of muscle", "receptors mobilizes additional transmitter for subsequent release by moving more acetylcholine vesicles toward the synaptic membrane. The second type of receptor is found on extrajunctional cells and is not normally involved in neuromuscular transmission. However, under certain conditions (eg, prolonged immobilization, thermal burns), these receptors may proliferate sufficiently to affect subsequent neuromuscular transmission. This proliferation of extrajunctional acetylcholine receptors may be clinically relevant when using depolarizing or nondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxant drugs and is described later. Skeletal muscle relaxation and paralysis can occur from interruption of function at several sites along the pathway from the CNS to myelinated somatic nerves, unmyelinated motor nerve terminals, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, the motor end plate, the muscle membrane, and the intracellular muscular contractile apparatus itself. Blockade of end plate function can be", "of the axon terminal release ACh into the cleft, which then binds to nicotinic ACh receptors on the sarcolemma of the striated muscle. The nicotinic ACh receptor in striated muscles is a transmitter-gated Na channel. Binding of ACh opens ACh Na channels, causing an influx of Na into striated muscle Na receptor cell. This influx results in a localized membrane depolariza tion, which in turn leads to the events described above. An enzyme called acetylcholinesterase (AChE) quickly breaks down the acetylcholine to prevent continued stimulation. For more detail description of ACh function, see Chapter 12. The muscle fiber cytoplasm that underlies the junctional folds contains nuclei, many mitochondria, rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum (rER), free ribosomes, and glycogen. These cytoplasmic organelles are believed to be involved in the synthesis of", "Continued agonist occupancy is associated with return of membrane voltage to the resting level.

Organ System Effects Most of the direct organ system effects of muscarinic cholinoceptor stimulants are readily predicted from knowledge of the effects of parasympathetic nerve stimulation (see Table 6\u20133) and the distribution of muscarinic receptors. Effects of a typical agent such as acetylcholine are listed in Table 7\u20133.

First, pharmacologic blockade of the physiologic agonist acetylcholine is characteristic of the antagonist neuromuscular blocking drugs (ie, nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs). These drugs prevent access of the transmitter to its receptor and thereby prevent depolarization. The prototype of this nondepolarizing subgroup is d-tubocurarine. The second mechanism of blockade can be produced by an excess of a depolarizing agonist, such as acetylcholine.

Exercises are likely to be effective, especially if they train muscles for the activities a person performs daily.

With the limb in the extended or flexed position, a new passive movement may not encounter the same sequence. Thus, the essential feature of spasticity is a velocity-dependent increase in the resistance of muscles to a passive stretch stimulus.

The cricoid cartilage consists of an anterior arch and a posterior broad-based plate. Articulat-ing with the posterior cricoid plate are the arytenoid cartilages. The vocal cords originate from the arytenoid cartilages and then attach to the thyroid cartilage.

This procedure is best performed in the operating room (OR) where there is optimal lighting and availability of advanced equipment (e.g., sternal saw). In these cases, often after a \u201cclothesline\u201d injury, direct visualization and instrumenta-tion of the trachea usually is done through the traumatic anterior neck defect or after a generous collar skin incision (Fig. 7-2).

In one study, more than 50% of the cases of phlebitis became evident more than 12 hours after discontinuation of intravenous catheters (96). Less than one-third of patients had symptoms related to the intravenous catheter site 24 hours before the diagnosis of phlebitis. Phlebitis can be diagnosed based on the presence of fever, pain, redness, induration, or a palpable venous cord. Occasionally, suppuration will be present. Phlebitis is usually self-limited and resolves within 3 to 4 days. The treatment includes application of warm, moist compresses and prompt removal of any", "a definitive diagnosis.

Even with needle aspiration of the leading edge or a punch biopsy of the cellulitis tissue itself, cultures are positive in only 20% of cases. This observation suggests that relatively low numbers of bacteria may cause cellulitis and that the expanding area of erythema within the skin may be a direct effect of extracellular toxins or of the soluble mediators of inflammation elicited by the host.

FUT can detect DVT in the calf, but high background radiation from the pelvis and the urinary tract limits its ability to detect proximal DVT. It also cannot be used in an extremity that has recently undergone surgery or has active inflammation.

Taken together, these techniques for analyzing and manipulating DNA have made it possible to sequence, identify, and isolate genes from any organism of interest.

New Nucleosomes Are Assembled Behind the Replication Fork Several additional aspects of DNA replication are specific to eukaryotes.

But changes that cause serious damage lead nowhere: the cell that suffers them dies, leaving no progeny. Through endless repetition of this cycle of error and trial\u2014of mutation and natural selection\u2014organisms evolve: their genetic specifications change, giving them new ways to exploit the environment more effectively, to survive in competition with others, and to reproduce successfully.

An alternative strategy, one that enriches for protein-coding genes, is to begin the cloning process by selecting only those DNA sequences that are transcribed into mRNA and thus correspond to protein-encoding genes. This is done by extracting the mRNA from cells and then making a DNA copy of each mRNA Figure 8\u201330 Human genomic libraries containing DNA fragments that represent the whole human genome can be constructed using restriction nucleases and DNA ligase.

However, the genomes of multicellular plants and animals, as well as many other eukaryotes, contain, in addition to genes, a large quantity of interspersed DNA whose function is poorly understood (Figure 4\u201313). Some of this additional DNA is crucial for the proper control of gene expression, and this may in part explain why there is so much of it in multicellular organisms, whose genes have to be switched on and off according to complicated rules during development (discussed in Chapters 7 and 21). Differences in the amount of DNA interspersed between genes, far more than differences in numbers of genes, account for the astonishing variations in genome size that we see", "begins and ends. One very important approach to deciphering our genome is to search for DNA sequences that are closely similar between different species, on the principle that DNA sequences that have a function are much more likely to be conserved than those without a function. For example, humans and mice are thought to have diverged from a common mammalian ancestor about 80 \u00d7 106 years ago, which is long enough for the majority of nucleotides in their genomes to have been changed by random mutational events. Consequently, the only regions that will have remained closely similar in the two genomes are those in which mutations would have impaired function and put the animals carrying them at a disadvantage, resulting in their elimination from the population by natural", "sequence of the 3.2 billion nucleotide pairs in the human genome is the fact that much of it is probably functionally unimportant. The regions of the genome that code for the amino acid sequences of proteins (the exons) are typically found in short segments (average size about 145 nucleotide pairs), small islands in a sea of DNA whose exact nucleotide sequence is thought to be mostly of little consequence. This arrangement makes it difficult to identify all the exons in a stretch of DNA, and it is often hard too to determine exactly where a gene begins and ends.

In both cases, the DNA sequences of these nuclear genes show clear evidence of their origin from the bacterial ancestor of the respective organelle. Natural selection has evidently favored mitochondria with small genomes. By contrast, the nuclear genomes of most eukaryotes seem to have been free to enlarge. Perhaps the eukaryotic way of life has made large size an advantage: predators typically need to be bigger than their prey, and cell size generally increases in proportion to genome size. Whatever the reason, aided by a massive accumulation of DNA segments derived from parasitic transposable elements (discussed in Chapter 5), the genomes of most eukaryotes have become orders of magnitude larger than those of bacteria and archaea (Figure 1\u201332).", "gene can in theory be accomplished through the introduction of a stop codon anywhere in the coding sequence, whereas activations require precise substitutions at residues that can somehow lead to an increase in the activity of the encoded protein. Importantly, the specificity of oncogene mutations provides diagnostic opportunities, as tests that identify mutations at defined positions are easier to design than tests aimed at detecting random changes in a gene. The second mechanism for activation of oncogenes is DNA sequence amplification, leading to overexpression of the gene product.

It is sensible to use a more activating agent (\ufb02uoxetine) in a lethargic patient and a more sedating agent (paroxetine) in an agitated patient (118). Nonetheless, responses vary on an individual basis, even within the same class of medications. The choice of antidepressant is based on side effects, dosage, cost, and the physician\u2019s clinical experience (Table 12.4).

Additional arousal-promoting neurons in the hypothalamus use the peptide neurotransmitter orexin (also known as hypocretin, shown in blue) to reinforce activity in the other arousal cell groups. Damage to the arousal system at the level of the rostral pons and lower midbrain causes coma, indicating that the ascending arousal influence from this level is critical in maintaining wakefulness. Damage to the hypothalamic branch of the arousal system causes profound sleepiness, but usually not coma. Specific loss of the orexin neurons produces the sleep disorder narcolepsy (see below). The arousal system is turned off during sleep by inhibitory inputs from cell groups in the sleep-promoting system, shown in Fig. 38-2 in", "the biogenic monoamines (norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine) are in some way involved in the biology of depression. However, most of the neurochemical theories of depression suffer from the weakness that they have been the result of backward reasoning from the effects of antidepressants on various neurotransmitters to the putative mechanisms of the disease. Following the observations that the tricyclic antidepressants and the monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors exerted their effect by increasing norepinephrine and serotonin at central adrenergic receptor sites in the limbic system and hypothalamus and that depression-provoking drugs (such as reserpine) deplete biogenic amines at these sites, it was proposed that naturally occurring depressions might be associated with a deficiency of these substances. Furthermore, depressed patients and their first-degree relatives, as well as healthy individuals, develop a", "and may be more likely to respond to serotonergic antidepressants. Studies of depressed patients have sometimes shown an alteration in monoamine function. For example, some studies have found evidence of alteration in serotonin receptor numbers (5-HT1A and 5-HT2C) or norepinephrine (\u03b12) receptors in depressed and suicidal patients, but these findings have not been consistent. A reduction in the primary serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in the cerebrospinal fluid is associated with violent and impulsive behavior, including violent suicide attempts.

Further study showed that the intracellular Ca concentration in the muscle (secondary to differences in the activity pattern of the motor neuron) was an important determinant of whether the muscle fiber expressed the slow myosin isoform or the fast myosin isoform (see the section The myosin isoforms expressed in skeletal muscle can be distinguished on the basis of myosin heavy chain composition (see Fig. 12.15 Table 12.1 ). Slow-twitch muscle fibers express type I myosin heavy chain, whereas fast-twitch skeletal muscle fibers could contain type IIa, type IIx, or type IIb myosin heavy chains. Some fast-twitch muscle fibers may contain a mixture of type II myosin isoforms. Slow-twitch skeletal muscles are also characterized by a high oxidative capacity (see Table 12.1 ), which", "most fibers of the extraocular muscles and the muscles that control the movements of the digits.

A muscle fiber is filled with longitudinally arrayed structural subunits called myofibrils (Fig. 11.4). Myofibrils are visible in favorable histologic preparations and are best seen in cross-sections of muscle fibers. In these sections they give the fiber a stippled appearance.

For finely controlled muscles, such as the eye muscles, an \u03b1 motor neuron may supply only a few muscle fibers. However, in a proximal limb muscle, such as the quadriceps femoris, a single \u03b1 motor neuron may innervate thousands of muscle fibers. The muscle fibers that belong to a given motor unit are called a muscle unit. All the muscle fibers in a muscle unit are of the same histochemical type (i.e., they are all either slow-twitch [type I] or fast-twitch [type IIA or IIB] fibers).

Reduction to lactate is the major fate for pyruvate in tissues that are poorly vascularized (for example, the lens and cornea of the eye and the kidney medulla) or in RBC that lack mitochondria. 1. Lactate formation in muscle: In exercising skeletal muscle, NADH production (by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and by the three NAD+-linked dehydrogenases of the TCA cycle, see p. 113) exceeds the oxidative capacity of the ETC. This results in an elevated NADH/NAD+ ratio, favoring reduction of pyruvate to lactate by LDH. Therefore, during intense", "example, the addition of lactate to the blood that perfuses a heart metabolizing glucose leads to a reduction in glucose uptake and vice versa. At normal blood concentrations, glucose and lactate are consumed at approximately equal rates. In contrast, uptake of pyruvate is very low, as is its arterial concentration. For glucose, the threshold concentration is approximately 4 mmol/L. Below this blood level, no glucose is taken up by the myocardium. Insulin reduces the glucose threshold and increases the rate of glucose uptake by the heart. Cardiac utilization of lactate occurs in most circumstances; insulin does not affect its uptake by the myocardium. Under hypoxic conditions, glucose utilization is facilitated by an increase in the rate of transport across the myocardial cell wall. However, lactate cannot be metabolized", "not affect its uptake by the myocardium. Under hypoxic conditions, glucose utilization is facilitated by an increase in the rate of transport across the myocardial cell wall. However, lactate cannot be metabolized by the hypoxic heart and is produced by the heart under anaerobic conditions. Associated with lactate production by the hypoxic heart is the breakdown of cardiac glycogen. Of the total cardiac O2 consumption, only 35% to 40% can be accounted for by the oxidation of carbohydrate. Thus the heart derives the major part of its energy from the oxidation of noncarbohydrate sources: namely, esterified and nonesterified fatty acids, which account for approximately 60% of the myocardial O2 consumption in people in the postabsorptive state. Various fatty acids have different thresholds for myocardial uptake, but these CHAPTER", "the heart preferentially uses the substrate that is available in the largest concentration. The oxidation of amino acids makes a small contribution to myocardial energy expenditure. Normally, the heart derives its energy by oxidative phosphorylation, in which each mole of glucose yields 36 mol of ATP. However, during hypoxia, glycolysis takes over, and 2 mol of ATP is provided by each mole of glucose; \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids is also curtailed. If hypoxia is prolonged, cellular creatine phosphate and eventually ATP are depleted. In ischemia, lactic acid accumulates and decreases intracellular pH. This condition inhibits glycolysis, fatty acid use, and protein synthesis, and therefore it results in cellular damage and eventually necrosis of myocardial cells. 1.

Aerobic glycolysis, in which pyruvate is the end product, occurs in cells with mitochondria and an adequate supply of oxygen ([O2], Fig. 8.25). Anaerobic glycolysis, in which lactic acid is the end product, occurs in cells that lack mitochondria and in cells deprived of sufficient O2.

The consequent reduction in cardiac output further reduces arterial pressure, a classic example of a positive feedback mechanism. Furthermore, reduced blood flow to peripheral tissues leads to an accumulation of vasodilator metabolites that decrease peripheral resistance and therefore aggravate the fall in arterial pressure. The inadequate blood flow during hemorrhage affects the metabolism of all cells. The decreased O2 delivery to cells accelerates tissue production of lactic acid and other acid metabolites. Moreover, impaired kidney function prevents adequate excretion of the excess H+ , and generalized metabolic acidosis ensues. The resulting depressant effect of acidosis on the heart is a further reduction in tissue perfusion, which aggravates the metabolic acidosis.

The greater glycogen stores within the muscle are not read-ily available for systemic use due to a deficiency in glucose-6-phosphatase but are available for the energy needs of muscle cells. Therefore, in the fasting state, hepatic glycogen stores are rapidly and preferentially depleted, which results in a fall of serum glucose concentration within hours (<16 hours).During fasting, a healthy 70-kg adult will utilize 180 g of glucose per day to support the metabolism of obligate glycolytic cells such as neurons, leukocytes, erythrocytes, and the renal medullae.

The Nature of Primary Metabolic Myopathies The chemical energy for muscle contraction is provided by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP); ATP is restored by phosphocreatine and ADP acting in combination. These reactions are particularly important during brief, high-intensity exercise. During periods of prolonged muscle activity, rephosphorylation requires the availability of carbohydrates, fatty acids, and ketones, which are catabolized in mitochondria. Glycogen is the main sarcoplasmic source of carbohydrate, but blood glucose also moves freely in and out of muscle cells as needed during sustained exercise. The fatty acids in the blood, derived mainly from adipose tissue and intracellular lipid stores, constitute the other major source of energy.

Glucose is the greatly preferred energy source for the brain and the required energy source for cells with few or no mitochondria such as mature red blood cells. Glucose is also essential as an energy source for exercising muscle, where it is the substrate for anaerobic glycolysis. Blood glucose can be obtained from three primary sources: the diet, glycogen degradation, and gluconeogenesis. Dietary intake of glucose and glucose precursors, such as starch (a polysaccharide), disaccharides, and monosaccharides, is sporadic and, depending on the diet, is not always a reliable source", "glycogen, which are then metabolized by a combination of glycolysis (in the cytosol) and oxidative phosphorylation (in the mitochondria) to yield the equivalent of 37 mol of ATP per mole of glucose 1-phosphate. Blood glucose yields 36 mol of ATP per mole of glucose because 1 ATP is used to phosphorylate glucose at the start of glycolysis. These ATP yields, however, are dependent on an adequate oxygen supply. Under anaerobic conditions, in contrast, metabolism of glycogen and glucose yields only 3 and 2 mol of ATP per mole of glucose 1-phosphate and glucose, respectively (along with 2 mol of lactate). As discussed later, muscle fatigue during prolonged exercise is associated with depletion of glycogen stores in the muscle. Fatty acids represent an important source of energy for muscle", "the lactate generated by glycolysis. The increased cardiac and respiratory work during recovery also contributes to the increased oxygen consumption seen at this time and explains why more oxygen has to be \u201crepaid\u201d than was \u201cborrowed.\u201d Some oxygen debt occurs even with low levels of exercise because slow oxidative motor units consume considerable ATP, derived from creatine phosphate or glycolysis, before oxidative metabolism can increase ATP production to meet steady-state requirements. The oxygen debt is much greater with strenuous exercise, when fast glycolytic motor units are used (Fig. 12.18 ). The oxygen debt is approximately equal to the energy consumed during exercise minus that supplied by oxidative metabolism (i.e., the darkand light-colored areas in Fig. 12.18 are approximately equal). As indicated earlier, the additional oxygen used during recovery", "step 6 begins the energy-generation phase of glycolysis. Because two molecules of aTp are hydrolyzed in the early, energy-investment phase, glycolysis results in the net synthesis of 2 aTp and 2 naDh molecules per molecule of glucose (see also panel 2\u20138). Figure 2\u201347 Two pathways for the anaerobic breakdown of pyruvate. (a) When there is inadequate oxygen, for example, in a muscle cell undergoing vigorous contraction, the pyruvate produced by glycolysis is converted to lactate as shown. This reaction regenerates the naD+ consumed in step 6 of glycolysis, but the whole pathway yields much less energy overall than complete oxidation.

The fatty acids in the blood, derived mainly from adipose tissue and intracellular lipid stores, constitute the other major source of energy. Carbohydrate is metabolized during aerobic and anaerobic phases of metabolism; the fatty acids are metabolized only aerobically. Resting muscle derives approximately 70 percent of its energy from the oxidation of long-chain fatty acids. As stated earlier, the circumstances during exercise are somewhat different. During a short period of intense exercise, the muscle uses carbohydrate derived from glycogen stores; myophosphorylase is the enzyme that initiates the metabolism of glycogen.

In a stuporous patient, for example, sensory examination is reduced to observing the briskness of withdrawal in response to a pinch or another noxious", "one area, their effect may be summated and a heightened perception of pain may result; therefore, they should be delivered about one per second and not over the same spot. Small differences in intensity can be discounted. An effective approach is to ask the patient to compare the pin sensation in two areas on a scale of 1 to 10; a report of \u201c8 or 9\u201d as compared to \u201c10\u201d is usually insignificant. It is almost impossible, using an ordinary pin, to apply each stimulus with equal intensity. A pinwheel (Wartenberg wheel) is sometimes more effective because it allows the application of a more constant pressure, but risk of transmission of blood-borne infection from patient to patient has made this method outdated.

This is evidence that pain is a distinct submodality that uses a set of fibers distinct from those used by low-threshold mechanoreceptors. These findings illustrate an important principle of sensory systems called labeled line. The idea is that the quality (i.e., modality) of a particular sensation results from the fact that it is conveyed to the CNS by a specific set of afferents that have a distinct set of targets in the nervous system. Alterations in activity in these afferents will therefore change only quantitative aspects of the sensation.

Despite its benefits, exercise presents challenges for individuals with DM because they lack the normal glucoregulatory mechanisms (normally, insulin falls and glucagon rises during exercise). Skeletal muscle is a major site for metabolic fuel consumption in the resting state, and the increased muscle activity during vigorous, aerobic exercise greatly increases fuel requirements.

Assuming that maximal benefit of MNT and increased physical activity has been realized, patients with mild to moderate hyperglycemia (FPG <11.1\u201313.9 mmol/L [200\u2013250 mg/dL]) often respond well to a single, oral glucose-lowering agent. Patients with more severe hyperglycemia (FPG >13.9 mmol/L [250 mg/dL]) may respond partially but are unlikely to achieve normoglycemia with oral monotherapy. A stepwise approach that starts with a single agent and adds a second agent to achieve the glycemic target can be used (see \u201cCombination therapy with glucose-lowering agents,\u201d below).

In the cardiovascular system, the cardiac output increment required by mild or moderate exercise is successfully provided until at least age 75 (in individuals without obvious cardiac disease), but the increase is the result primarily of increased stroke volume in the elderly and not tachycardia, as in young adults. Average blood pressure goes up with age (in most Western countries), but the incidence of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension also increases markedly. It is thus particularly important to check for orthostatic hypotension (>20 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure on standing) on every visit. Similarly, the average 2-hour postprandial blood glucose level increases by about 1 mg/ dL for each year of age above 50. Temperature regulation", "defense against acute hypoglycemia. As plasma glucose levels fall further, symptoms prompt behavioral defense against hypoglycemia, including the ingestion of food (Table 420-2; Fig. 420-1).

They shift to higher-thannormal glucose levels in people with poorly controlled diabetes, who can experience symptoms of hypoglycemia when their glucose levels decline toward the normal range (pseudohypoglycemia). On the other hand, thresholds shift to lower-than-normal glucose levels in people with recurrent hypoglycemia; e.g., patients with aggressively treated diabetes or an insulinoma have symptoms at glucose levels lower than those that cause symptoms in healthy individuals.

Blood glucose yields 36 mol of ATP per mole of glucose because 1 ATP is used to phosphorylate glucose at the start of glycolysis. These ATP yields, however, are dependent on an adequate oxygen supply. Under anaerobic conditions, in contrast, metabolism of glycogen and glucose yields only 3 and 2 mol of ATP per mole of glucose 1-phosphate and glucose, respectively (along with 2 mol of lactate).

The Nature of Primary Metabolic Myopathies The chemical energy for muscle contraction is provided by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP); ATP is restored by phosphocreatine and ADP acting in combination. These reactions are particularly important during brief, high-intensity exercise. During periods of prolonged muscle activity, rephosphorylation requires the availability of carbohydrates, fatty acids, and ketones, which are catabolized in mitochondria. Glycogen is the main sarcoplasmic source of carbohydrate, but blood glucose also moves freely in and out of muscle cells as needed during sustained exercise. The fatty acids in the blood, derived mainly from adipose tissue and intracellular lipid stores, constitute the other major source of energy. Carbohydrate is metabolized during aerobic and", "although the accumulation of various metabolic products (lactate, Pi, ADP) has been implicated. In view of the importance of preventing depletion of myoplasmic ATP, which would affect the viability of the cell, it is likely that multiple mechanisms may have been developed to induce fatigue and hence lower the rate of ATP hydrolysis before the individual risks injury or death of the skeletal muscle cell. 11. When the energy demands of an exercising muscle cannot be met by oxidative metabolism, an oxygen debt is incurred. Increased breathing during the recovery period after exercise reflects this oxygen debt.

The oxygen debt is much greater with strenuous exercise, when fast glycolytic motor units are used (Fig. 12.18 ). The oxygen debt is approximately equal to the energy consumed during exercise minus that supplied by oxidative metabolism (i.e., the darkand light-colored areas in Fig. 12.18 are approximately equal).

In severe hypoxia, when ATP production is inadequate to meet the energy requirements of ionic and osmotic equilibrium, cell membrane depolarization leads to uncontrolled Ca2+ influx and activation of Ca2+-dependent phospholipases and proteases. These events, in turn, cause cell swelling, activation of apoptotic pathways, and, ultimately, cell death.

Because of its straight course, the probability of viewing both the duct and the secretory portion of an apocrine gland in the same histologic section is reduced.

Cells lining the ducts of exocrine glands (as found, for example, in the pancreas and liver, and in mammary, sweat, and salivary glands) secrete large volumes of body fluids. These cells are organized into epithelial sheets in which their apical plasma membrane faces the lumen of the duct. Ion pumps and channels situated in the basolateral and apical plasma membrane move ions (mostly Na+ and Cl\u2013) into the ductal lumen, creating an osmotic gradient between the surrounding tissue and the duct. Water molecules rapidly follow the osmotic gradient through aquaporins that are present in high concentrations in both the apical and basolateral membranes.

Intercalated ducts are located between a secretory acinus and a larger duct. Intercalated ducts are lined by low cuboidal epithelial cells that usually lack any distinctive feature to suggest a function other than that of a conduit.

Thus, the saliva may become isotonic to hypertonic. The diameter of striated ducts often exceeds that of the secretory acinus. Striated ducts are located in the parenchyma of the glands (they are intralobular ducts) but may be surrounded by small amounts of connective tissue in which blood vessels and nerves can be seen running in parallel with the duct.

The neurotransmitter released by parasympathetic postganglionic neurons is acetylcholine. The effects of these neurons on various target organs are listed in Table 11.1 . Parasympathetic postganglionic actions are mediated by muscarinic receptors.

Alternatively, the patient is asked to produce a maximal contraction and the examiner estimates power by the force needed to overcome or \u201cbreak\u201d it (isometric contraction or maximum voluntary isometric contraction).

Myoadenylate Deaminase Deficiency The muscle enzyme myoadenylate deaminase converts adenosine-5\u2032-monophosphate (5\u2032-AMP) to inosine monophosphate (IMP) with liberation of ammonia. Myoadenylate deaminase may play a role in regulating adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels in muscles. Most individuals with myoadenylate deaminase deficiency have no symptoms. There have been a few reports of patients with this disorder who have exercise-exacerbated myalgia and myoglobinuria. Many questions have been raised about the clinical effects of myoadenylate deaminase deficiency, and, specifically, its relationship to exertional myalgia and fatigability, but there is no consensus. In 1972, Olson and colleagues recognized", "DM should (1) monitor blood glucose before, during, and after exercise; (2) delay exercise if blood glucose is >14 mmol/L (250 mg/ dL) and ketones are present; (3) if the blood glucose is <5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL), ingest carbohydrate before exercising; (4) monitor glu cose during exercise and ingest carbohydrate to prevent hypoglycemia; (5) decrease insulin doses (based on previous experience) before exercise and inject insulin into a nonexercising area; and (6) learn individual glucose responses to different types of exercise and increase food intake for up to 24 h after exercise, depending on intensity and duration of exercise. In individuals with type 2 DM, exercise-related hypoglycemia is less common but can occur in individuals taking either insulin or insulin secretagogues. younger age in both type 1 and", "aerobic exercise, blood flow to muscle and the availability of glucose and fatty acids are increased. At first, glucose is the main source of energy during exercise; later, with exhaustion of glycogen stores, energy is provided by oxidation of fatty acids. Thus, muscle failure at a certain phase of exercise is predictive of the type of energy failure. A rising blood concentration of \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate reflects the increasing oxidation of fatty acids, and an increase in blood lactate reflects the anaerobic metabolism of glucose. The cytochrome oxidative mechanisms are essential in both aerobic and anaerobic muscle metabolism; these mechanisms are considered in Chap. 36 in relation to the mitochondrial diseases in which muscle tissue is prominently involved, and they are referred to here only briefly. It follows from these", "of high-intensity exercise or prolonged exercise, the myoplasmic ATP level does not decrease substantially. In view of the reliance of all cells on the availability of ATP to maintain viability, fatigue has been described as a protective mechanism to minimize the risk of muscle cell injury or death. Consequently, it is likely that skeletal muscle cells have developed redundant systems to ensure that ATP levels do not drop to dangerously low levels and hence risk the viability of the cell. Most persons tire and cease exercise long before the motor unit fatigues. General physical fatigue may be defined as a homeostatic disturbance produced by work. The basis for the perceived discomfort (or even pain) probably involves many factors.

Muscle biopsy does not show lipid accumulation and is usually normal between attacks. The diagnosis requires direct measurement of muscle CPT or genetic testing.

Arterial oxygen desaturation, a failure to decrease dead space appropriately with exercise (i.e., a high Vd/Vt [dead space/tidal volume] ratio [Chap. 306e]), and an excessive increase in respiratory rate with a lower than expected recruitment of tidal volume provide useful information about physiologic abnormalities and extent of disease.

Despite the universality of the central dogma of molecular biology, there are important variations between organisms in the way in which information flows from DNA to protein.

Hyperkinetic movement disorders are characterized by involuntary movements unaccompanied by weakness and occurring in isolation or in combination (Table 449-6). The major hyperkinetic movement disorders and the diseases with which they are associated are considered in this section. Tremor consists of alternating contractions of agonist and antagonist muscles in an oscillating, rhythmic manner. It can be most prominent at rest (rest tremor), on assuming a posture (postural tremor), or on actively reaching for a target (kinetic tremor). Tremor is also assessed based on distribution, frequency, and related neurologic dysfunction. PD is characterized by a resting tremor, essential tremor (ET) by a postural tremor (trying to sustain a posture), and cerebellar disease by an intention or kinetic tremor", "lower brainstem; this presumably involves limb innervation via the reticulospinal pathway. Alternative possibilities are that the lesion in the ventromedial tegmentum interrupts the brachium conjunctivum, a tegmental-thalamic projection, or the descending limb of the superior cerebellar peduncle, which functions as a link in a dentatoreticular-cerebellar feedback mechanism (see Fig. 5-3). The differential effect of drugs on tremor and bradykinesia suggest that they must have separate mechanisms. Intention (Ataxic, Cerebellar, Goal-Directed Action) Tremor As will be discussed in Chap. 5, the word intention is ambiguous in this context because the tremor itself is not intentional and occurs not when the patient intends to make a movement but only during the most demanding phases of active performance. In this sense it is a kinetic or action tremor, but the latter", "opposed to tremor that is apparent in a position of rest or repose. Action tremors can be roughly divided into two categories: goal directed action tremor of the ataxic type related to cerebellar disorders (discussed in Chap. 5) and postural tremors, which are either the enhanced physiologic variety or essential tremor (Fig. 4-6). A postural tremor occurs with the limbs and trunk actively maintained in certain positions (such as holding the arms outstretched) and may persist throughout active movement. More particularly, the tremor is absent when the limbs are relaxed but becomes evident when the muscles are activated. The tremor is accentuated as greater precision of movement is demanded, but it does not approach the degree of augmentation seen with cerebellar intention tremor. Most cases of action tremor", "intention tremor is known as the Charcot triad. While this group of symptoms is often seen in the advanced stages of the disease, most neurologists would agree that it is not a common mode of presentation. The most severe forms of cerebellar ataxia, in which the slightest attempt to move the trunk or limbs precipitate a violent and uncontrollable ataxic tremor, are observed among patients with long-standing MS. The responsible lesion probably lies in the tegmentum of the midbrain and involves the dentatorubrothalamic tracts and adjacent structures. Cerebellar ataxia may be combined with sensory ataxia, owing to involvement of the posterior columns of the spinal cord or medial lemnisci of the brainstem. In most cases of this type, the signs of spinal cord involvement ultimately predominate; in others,", "rigid postures, slowness of alternating movements, hypokinetic ballistic movements, and resting tremor are not part of the clinical picture. The gait tends to be short-stepped but not shuffling and there is more of a tendency to retropulsion than there is in Parkinson disease. Sometimes a lumbar puncture gives surprising benefit, indicating hydrocephalus as the cause of the motor slowing and gait disorder. Essential tremor may cause difficulty in diagnosis as already mentioned but it is distinguished by its fine, quick quality, its tendency to become manifest during volitional movement and to disappear when the limb is in a position of repose, and the lack of associated slowness of movement or of flexed postures.

An impression of Parkinson disease may be conveyed, with short steps and slightly stooped, forward-leaning posture, but the resemblance is superficial because there is typically no shuffling, nor is there festination, rigidity, slowness of alternating movement, or tremor.

It was also notable that a common associated behavioral abnormality was abulia (apathy and loss of initiative), in those with caudate lesions.

In the early stages, they may show some modest benefit from levodopa and be difficult to distinguish from PD. Pathologically, neurodegeneration typically involves degeneration of the SNc but occurs without Lewy bodies (see below for individual conditions).

Glucose sparing means the switching of fuel utilization from glucose to a nongluconeogenic fuel in most cell types, but especially in skeletal muscle, which represents the potentially largest single consumer of glucose.

Increased glucose transport: The transient increase in plasma glucose and insulin after a carbohydrate-rich meal leads to an increase in glucose transport into muscle cells (myocytes) by GLUT-4 (see p. 97 and Fig. 24.7, ), thereby reducing blood glucose.

Hepatocytes express the GLUT2 isoform of the glucose transporter, which is not regulated by insulin for its insertion into the cell membrane. In contrast, skeletal myocytes and adipocytes express the GLUT4 isoform. Newly synthesized GLUT4 exists in an intracellular inactive state with GLUT4 storage vesicles (G4-i in Fig. 39.3B ). Insulin induces translocation of GLUT4 to the cell membrane, where it can function as an active glucose transporter (G4-m in Fig. 39.3A). After its phosphorylation to G6P by glucokinase, hepatocytes convert some of the imported glucose into the storage form, glycogen, during the digestive phase (see Fig. 39.3A ). Similarly, skeletal muscle converts some of the", "to glucose 6-phosphate by hexokinase and metabolized to meet the energy needs of myocytes. 2. Increased glycogenesis: The increased insulin/glucagon ratio and the availability of glucose 6-phosphate favor glycogen synthesis, particularly if glycogen stores have been depleted as a result of exercise (see p. 126 and Fig. 24.7, ). B. Fat metabolism FA are released from chylomicrons and VLDL by the action of LPL (see pp. 228 and 231). However, FA are of secondary importance as a fuel for resting muscle during the well-fed state, in which glucose is the primary source of energy. C. Amino acid metabolism 1.

Insulin (discussed in detail later) regulates essentially every aspect of metabolism during the digestive phase.

The relative amounts of glucagon and insulin released are normally regulated such that the rate of hepatic glucose production is kept equal to the use of glucose by peripheral tissues.

In particular, insulin secretion is increased by glucose, amino acids, and gastrointestinal peptide hormones. a. Glucose: Ingestion of a carbohydrate-rich meal leads to a rise in blood glucose, the primary stimulus for insulin secretion (see Fig. 23.5).

Thus, glucokinase functions only when the intracellular concentration of glucose in the hepatocyte is elevated such as during the brief period following consumption of a carbohydrate-rich meal, when high levels of glucose are delivered to the liver via the portal vein. Glucokinase has a high Vmax, allowing the liver to effectively remove the flood of glucose delivered by the portal blood. This prevents large amounts of glucose from entering the systemic circulation following such a meal, thereby minimizing hyperglycemia during the absorptive period.

CYCLE OVERVIEW The tricarboxylic acid cycle ([TCA cycle] also called the citric acid cycle, or the Krebs cycle) plays several roles in metabolism. It is the final pathway where the oxidative catabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, and fatty acids converge, their carbon skeletons being converted to carbon dioxide (CO2), as shown in cycle. The TCA cycle is an aerobic pathway, because oxygen (O2) is required as the final electron acceptor. Reactions such as the catabolism of some amino acids generate intermediates of the cycle and are called anaplerotic (from the Greek for \u201cfilling up\u201d) reactions. The TCA cycle also provides intermediates for a number of important anabolic reactions, such as", "Ketone bodies are an alternate to the use of glucose, and, thus, dependence on glucose increases. Because FA \u03b2-oxidation supplies the NADH and the nucleoside triphosphates needed for gluconeogenesis, glucose production decreases. The result is a hypoketotic hypoglycemia. Recall that this was seen with medium-chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency. Case 4: Answers to Review Questions RQ1.Answer = D. The rise in reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) in the mitochondria decreases the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, fatty acid (FA) oxidation, and gluconeogenesis. NADH inhibits the isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction, the key regulated step of the TCA cycle, and the \u03b1ketoglutarate dehydrogenase reaction (see figure at bottom right). It also favors the reduction of oxaloacetate (OAA) to malate (not malate to OAA), decreasing the availability of OAA for condensation with", "energy (as ATP) and intermediates for other metabolic pathways. Glycolysis is at the hub of carbohydrate metabolism because virtually all sugars, whether arising from the diet or from catabolic reactions in the body, can ultimately be converted to glucose (Fig. 8.9A). Pyruvate is the end product of glycolysis in cells with mitochondria and an adequate supply of O2. This series of ten reactions is called aerobic glycolysis because O2 is required to reoxidize the NADH formed during the oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (Fig. 8.9B). Aerobic glycolysis sets the stage for the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl CoA, a major fuel of the TCA cycle. Alternatively, pyruvate is reduced to lactate as NADH is oxidized to NAD+ (Fig. 8.9C). This conversion of glucose to lactate is called anaerobic", "processes required in different tissues are not the same.

The resulting elevated hepatic acetyl CoA produced by fatty acid oxidation inhibits pyruvate dehydrogenase (see p. 111) and activates pyruvate carboxylase ([PC] see p. 119). The OAA produced by PC is used by the liver for gluconeogenesis rather than for the TCA cycle. Additionally, fatty acid oxidation decreases the NAD+/NADH ratio, and the rise in NADH shifts OAA to malate (see p. 113).

Regardless of therapy or care, hypertension will be controlled only if patients are motivated to maintain their treatment plan. If blood pressure control is not easily achieved, if the systolic blood pressure is higher than 180 mm Hg, or if the diastolic reading is higher than 110 mm Hg, referral to an internist is recommended. Referral is indicated if secondary hypertension is suspected or evidence of end-organ damage (renal insufficiency or congestive heart failure) is present.

In addition, an elevated JVP has prognostic significance in patients with both symptomatic heart failure and asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction. The presence of an elevated JVP is associated with a higher risk of subsequent hospitalization for heart failure, death from heart failure, or both. Assessment of Blood Pressure Measurement of blood pressure usually is delegated to a medical assistant but should be repeated by the clinician. Accurate measurement depends on body position, arm size, time of measurement, place of measurement, device, device size, technique, and examiner. In general, physician-recorded blood pressures are higher than both", "evidence of end-organ damage (renal insufficiency or congestive heart failure) is present. Measurement of Blood Pressure An essential variable in evaluation of hypertension is how measurements are obtained and the need to standardize measurements (19). \u201cWhite coat\u201d or office hypertension (i.e., elevated just by seeing a physician) may occur in up to 30% of patients. For patients who have repeated normal measures outside of the office, it is reasonable to use ambulatory or home monitoring devices. Given the variation of accuracy and patient interpretation, it is advisable for the patient to bring their blood pressure unit into the office to calibrate it against the office-based measurements. In most patients, office readings are sufficient to adequately diagnose and monitor hypertension and eliminate problems of reliability with commercial devices and", "calibrated. For these reasons, when using direct mea-surement of intra-arterial pressure to monitor patients, clinicians should make clinical decisions based primarily on the measured mean arterial blood pressure.The radial artery at the wrist is the site most commonly used for intra-arterial pressure monitoring. Other sites include the femoral and axillary artery. It is important to recognize, however, that measured arterial pressure is determined in part by the site where the pressure is monitored. Central (i.e., aortic) and peripheral (e.g., radial artery) pressures typically are dif-ferent as a result of the impedance and inductance of the arte-rial tree. Systolic pressures typically are higher and diastolic pressures are lower in the periphery, whereas mean pressure is approximately the same in the aorta and more distal sites.Distal ischemia is an uncommon", "is ideally performed and recorded in a relatively uniform manner in order to avoid omissions and facilitate the subsequent analysis of records. Some variation in the order of examination from physician to physician is understandable, but each examiner over time establishes a consistent pattern. If certain portions are intentionally not performed, these omissions should be stated so that those reading the description at a later time are not left wondering whether an abnormality was not previously detected. Portions of the general physical examination that may be particularly informative in the patient with neurologic disease should be included. For example, examination of the heart rate and blood pressure, as well as carotid and cardiac auscultation, may be essential in a patient with stroke. Likewise, the skin and eyes can", "are indicative of a serious perturbation in normal physiology. Arterial blood pressure is a complex function of both cardiac output and vascular input impedance. Thus, inex-perienced clinicians may assume that the presence of a normal blood pressure is evidence that cardiac output and tissue perfu-sion are adequate. This assumption is frequently incorrect and is the reason why some critically ill patients may benefit from forms of hemodynamic monitoring in addition to measurement of arterial pressure.Blood pressure can be determined directly by measuring the pressure within the arterial lumen or indirectly using a cuff around an extremity. When the equipment is properly set up and calibrated, direct intra-arterial monitoring of blood pressure pro-vides accurate and continuous data. Additionally, intra-arterial catheters provide a convenient way to obtain samples of blood", "140/90 mm Hg have been arbitrarily used since the 1950s to define \"hypertension\" in nonpregnant individuals.

This method is capable of providing continuous information, since systolic and diastolic blood pressures are recorded on a beat-to-beat basis. Photoplethysmography uses the transmission of infrared light to estimate the amount of hemoglobin (directly related to the volume of blood) in a finger placed under a servo-controlled inflatable cuff. A feedback loop controlled by a microprocessor continually adjusts the pressure in the cuff to maintain the blood volume of the finger constant. Under these conditions, the pressure in the cuff reflects the pressure in the digi-tal artery.

Release of cholecystokinin (CCK) from the duodenal and proximal jejunal mucosa (Ito cells) is largely triggered by long-chain fatty acids, essential amino acids (tryptophan, phenylalanine, valine, methionine), and gastric acid itself.

The cuff of the endotracheal tube should be placed below the fistula, avoiding overinflation. To minimize aspiration, a gastrostomy tube should be placed for gastric decompression (to prevent reflux) and a jejunostomy tube for feeding. If aspira-tion persists, esophageal diversion with cervical esophagostomy can be performed.

Oxidation of acetyl coenzyme A: The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (see p. 109) is the final common pathway in the oxidation of fuel molecules that produce acetyl CoA. Oxidation of acetyl CoA generates large amounts of ATP via oxidative phosphorylation as electrons flow from NADH and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH2) to oxygen ([O2] see p. 73). C. Anabolic pathways In contrast to catabolism, anabolism is a divergent process in which a few biosynthetic precursors (such as amino acids) form a wide variety of polymeric, or complex, products (such as proteins [Fig. 8.4]). Anabolic reactions require energy (are endergonic), which is generally provided by the hydrolysis of ATP to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic", "prominent of these reactions is the generation of ATP by the phosphorylation of ADP.

Thus, when a septic patient with a high probability of P. aeruginosa infection is encountered in such settings, empirical combination therapy should be administered until the pathogen is identified and susceptibility data become available. Thereafter, whether one or two agents should be continued remains a matter of individual preference. Recent studies suggest that extended infusions of \u03b2-lactams such as cefepime or piperacillin-tazobactam may result in better outcomes of Pseudomonas bacteremia and possibly Pseudomonas pneumonia. Acute Pneumonia Respiratory infections are the most common of all infections caused by P. aeruginosa. This organism appears first or second among the causes of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). However, much debate centers on the actual role of P. aeruginosa in VAP. Many of the relevant data are based on cultures", "other confirmed or suspected sites of infection may require ongoing antibiotic therapy, but the spectrum of pathogens (and the corresponding antibiotic choices) may be different from those for VAP. If the CPIS decreases over the first 3 days, antibiotics should be stopped after 8 days. An 8-day course of therapy is just as effective as a 2-week course and is associated with less frequent emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains. The major controversy regarding specific therapy for VAP concerns the need for ongoing combination treatment of Pseudomonas infection.

Chronic use of \ufb02uoroquinolones for prophylaxis is not advised because these agents are notorious for inducing antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria.

Second, early-onset nosocomial pneumonia, which manifests within the first 4 days of hospitalization, is most often caused by community-acquired pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus species, although some studies have challenged this view. Late-onset pneumonias most commonly are due to S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, Enterobacter species, Klebsiella pneumoniae, or Acinetobacter. When invasive techniques are used to diagnose VAP, the proportion of isolates accounted for by gram-negative bacilli decreases", "therapy may be of use in patients with infection caused by gas-forming organisms (e.g., C perfringens), although the evidence to support efficacy is limited to underpowered studies and case reports. In the absence of such infection, hyperbaric oxygen therapy has not been shown to be effective.77Postoperative Nosocomial InfectionsSurgical patients are prone to develop a wide variety of nosoco-mial infections during the postoperative period, which include SSIs, UTIs, pneumonia, and bacteremia. SSIs are discussed ear-lier, and the latter types of nosocomial infections are related to prolonged use of indwelling tubes and catheters for the purpose of urinary drainage, ventilation, and venous and arterial access, respectively.The presence of a postoperative UTI should be considered based on urinalysis demonstrating WBCs or bacteria, a positive test for leukocyte esterase, or a combination", "clinical experience with these agents.

This pool, however, is continually replenished during contraction, as described later, so that even when the muscle fatigues, ATP stores are only modestly decreased. Muscle cells contain creatine phosphate, which is used to convert ADP to ATP and thus replenish the ATP store during muscle contraction. The creatine phosphate store represents the immediate high-energy source for replenishing the ATP supply in skeletal muscle, especially during intense exercise.

Cellular calcium levels control muscle contraction (see Chapter 16) and alterations are implicated in neurodegeneration and apoptosis. Clearly, cells and organisms depend on mitochondria in many different ways.

Skeletal muscle fatigue during intense exercise is associated with depletion of the creatine phosphate store, although as described subsequently, this does not necessarily imply that the fatigue is caused by depletion of the creatine phosphate store.

Discuss the following problems. 14\u20134 In the 1860s, Louis Pasteur noticed that when he added O2 to a culture of yeast growing anaerobically on glucose, the rate of glucose consumption declined dramatically. Explain the basis for this result, which is known as the Pasteur effect. 14\u20135 Heart muscle gets most of the ATP needed to power its continual contractions through oxidative phosphorylation. When oxidizing glucose to CO2, heart muscle consumes O2 at a rate of 10 \u03bcmol/min per g of tissue, in order to replace the ATP used in contraction and give a steady-state ATP concentration of 5 \u03bcmol/g of tissue. At this rate, What structures are needed to form the barriers that separate and maintain the differentiated membrane domains in a single continuous", "muscle. Chemical signals such as InsP3 or a localized increase in intracellular [Ca++] (e.g., within the gap between the caveolae and SR) functionally link the sarcolemma and the SR. Smooth muscle cells contain a prominent rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus, which are located centrally at each end of the nucleus. These structures reflect significant protein synthetic and secretory functions. The scattered mitochondria are sufficient for oxidative phosphorylation to generate the increased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) consumed during contraction. The thick and thin filaments of smooth muscle cells are about 10,000 times longer than their diameter and are tightly packed. Therefore the probability of observing an intact filament by electron microscopy is extremely low. In contrast to skeletal muscle, which contains a transverse alignment of thick and thin filaments", "metabolic needs are readily met by oxidative phosphorylation. Fatigue of smooth muscle does not occur unless the cell is deprived of oxygen. However, aerobic glycolysis with lactic acid production normally supports membrane ion pumps even when oxygen is plentiful. Regulation of Myoplasmic Calcium Concentration The mechanisms that couple activation to contraction in smooth muscle involve two Ca++ sources: one involving the sarcolemma and the other involving the SR. The sarcolemma regulates Ca++ influx and efflux from the extracellular Ca++ pool. The SR membranes determine Ca++ movement between the myoplasm and the SR pool. Skeletal muscle contraction does not require extracellular Ca++ (see ). In contrast, extracellular Ca++ is important for smooth muscle contraction. Thus regulation of myoplasmic [Ca++] involves not only the SR but also the sarcolemma (", "when a diagnosis issuspected.

Mitochondria are very complex organelles located in virtually all cells of the body. They perform a variety of functions such as intracellular signaling of oxygen tension and key roles in programmed cell death. From a biochemical perspective, mitochondria are the key site of energy production in the cell.

Studies consistently show that 25% to 50% of patients suffer moderate to severe pain in the postoperative period (38,39). There are several reasons for the existing inadequacies in pain management. First, patient expectations of pain relief are low and they are not aware of the extent of analgesia that they should expect. In a study of the perception of pain relief after surgery, 86% of patients had moderate to severe pain after surgery, but 70% felt that the pain was as severe as they expected (40).
