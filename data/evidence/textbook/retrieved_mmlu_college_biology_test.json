Combination therapy also helps to protect against the selection of artemisinin resistance. However, with completion of dosing after 3 days, the artemisinin components are rapidly eliminated, and so selection of resistance to partner drugs is of concern. The WHO recommends five artemisinin-based combinations for the treatment of uncomplicated falciparum malaria (Table 52\u20134).

Universality: The genetic code is virtually universal insofar as its specificity has been conserved from very early stages of evolution, with only slight differences in the manner in which the code is translated.

This redundancy implies either that there is more than one tRNA for many of the amino acids or that some tRNA molecules can base-pair with more than one codon. In fact, both situations occur. Some amino acids have more than one tRNA and some tRNAs are constructed so that they require accurate base-pairing only at the first two positions of the codon and can tolerate a mismatch (or wobble) at the third position (Figure 6\u201351). This wobble base-pairing explains why so many of the alternative codons for an amino acid differ only in their third nucleotide (see Figure 6\u201348).

Because of this decoding, the information carried on mRNA relies on tRNA. Translation involves all three RNAs. The precise transfer of information from mRNA to protein is governed by genetic code, the set of rules by which codons are translated into an amino acid (Table 15-2). A codon, a triplet of three bases, codes for one amino acid. In this case, random combinations of the four bases form 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 4, or 64 codes. Because 64 codes are more than enough for 20 amino acids, most amino acids are coded by more than one codon.

Other processes serve to maintain actin in a globular form and thus to prevent the fibril formation necessary for contractions. B. Uterine contractions result from reversal of these sequences. Actin now assumes a fibrillar form, and calcium enters the cell to combine with calmodulin to form complexes. These complexes activate MLCK to bring about phosphorylation of the myosin light chains. This generates ATPase activityto cause sliding of myosin over the actin fibrils, which is a uterine contraction.

As a result, a rod cell can respond to even a single photon of light in a way that is highly reproducible in its timing and magnitude. Likewise, when an extracellular signal molecule binds to a receptor that indirectly activates adenylyl cyclase via Gs, each receptor protein may activate many molecules of Gs protein, each of which can activate a cyclase molecule. Each cyclase molecule, in turn, can catalyze the conversion of a large number of ATP molecules to cAMP molecules. A similar amplification operates in the IP3 signaling pathway. In these ways, a nanomolar (10\u20139 M) change in the concentration of an extracellular signal can induce micromolar (10\u20136 M) changes in the concentration of a second messenger such as cAMP or Ca2+. Because these", "interaction is brought about by enzymatic phosphorylation of the 20-kDa light chain of myosin (Stull, 1998). his is catalyzed by the enzyme myosin light-chain kinase, which is activated by calcium. Calcium binds to calmodulin, a calcium-binding regulatory protein, which in turn binds to and activates myosin lightchain kinase. hus, logically, uterine relaxation ordinarily is promoted by conditions that lower concentrations of (Ca2+)i. In contrast, prostaglandin dehydrogenase; SPA surfactant protein A. agents that prompt contraction act on myometrial cells to augment (Ca2+)i levels. Or, they allow an inlux of extracellular calcium through ligand-or voltage-regulated calcium channels (see Fig. 21-6). Voltage-gated ion channels open, additional calcium ions move into the cell, and cellular depolarization follows. For example, prostaglandin F2ex and oxytocin bind their respective receptors during labor to open ligand-activated", "concentration stimulates guanylyl cyclase to replenish the cyclic GMP, rapidly returning its level to where it was before the light was switched on. A specific Ca2+-sensitive protein mediates the activation of guanylyl cyclase in response to the fall in Ca2+ levels. In contrast to calmodulin, this protein is inactive when Ca2+ is bound to it and active when it is Ca2+-free. It therefore stimulates the cyclase when Ca2+ levels fall following a light response. Negative feedback mechanisms do more than just return the rod to its resting state after a transient light flash; they also help the rod to adapt, stepping down the response when the rod is exposed to light continuously. Adaptation, as we discussed earlier, allows the receptor cell to function as a sensitive detector of", "molecules such as adenylyl cyclase (AC) or phospholipase C (PLC), or directly by regulating ion channel or kinase function. cAMP cyclic adenosine monophosphate; DAG diacylglycerol; IP3 inositol triphosphate. levels of cAMP, and myometrial cell relaxation.

If the mutation has a significantly deleterious effect, it will simply be eliminated by purifying selection and will not become fixed. (In the most extreme case, the individual carrying the mutation will die without producing progeny.) Conversely, the rare mutations that confer a major reproductive advantage on individuals who inherit them can spread rapidly in the population. Because humans reproduce sexually and genetic recombination occurs each time a gamete is formed (discussed in Chapter 5), the genome of each individual who has inherited the mutation will be a unique recombinational mosaic of segments inherited from a large number of ancestors. The selected mutation along", "we saw earlier, they account for most of the DNA sequence differences between apes and humans. The spread of neutral mutations is not as rapid as the spread of the rare strongly advantageous mutations. It depends on a random variation in the number of mutation-bearing progeny produced by each mutation-bearing individual, causing changes in the relative frequency of the mutant allele in the population. Through a sort of \u201crandom walk\u201d process, the mutant allele may eventually become extinct, or it may become commonplace.

Detailed analyses of data on human genetic variation have suggested an ancestral population size of approximately 10,000 at the time when the current pattern of genetic variation was largely established. With a population that has reached this size, the probability that a new, selectively neutral mutation would become fixed is small (1/20,000), while the average time to fixation would be on the order of 800,000 years (assuming a 20-year generation time).

It concerns the initial and final energy states of the reaction components, not the reaction mechanism or how much time it takes for the chemical change to occur.

This loss reflects a reduction of orderliness in the way the energy and molecules were stored in the paper. We shall discuss free energy in more detail shortly, but the general principle is clear enough intuitively: chemical reactions proceed spontaneously only in the direction that leads to a loss of free energy. In other words, the spontaneous direction for any reaction is the direction that goes \u201cdownhill,\u201d where a \u201cdownhill\u201d reaction is one that is energetically favorable. Although the most energetically favorable form of carbon under ordinary conditions is CO2, and that of hydrogen is H2O, a living organism does not disappear in a puff of smoke, and the paper book in your hands does not burst into flames. This", "can this be quantified? According to the second law of thermodynamics the universe tends toward maximum disorder (largest entropy or greatest probability). Thus, a chemical reaction can proceed spontaneously only if it results in a net increase in the disorder of the universe (see Figure 2\u201316). This disorder of the universe can be expressed most conveniently in terms of the free energy of a system, a concept we touched on earlier. Free energy, G, is an expression of the energy available to do work\u2014for example, the work of driving chemical reactions. The value of G is of interest only when a system undergoes a change, denoted \u2206G (delta G). The change in G is critical because, as explained in Panel 2\u20137 (pp. 102\u2013103), \u2206G is a direct measure", "carbon dioxide as gases. The reaction is irreversible, since the smoke and ashes never spontaneously retrieve these entities from the heated atmosphere and reconstitute themselves into paper. When the paper burns, its chemical energy is dissipated as heat\u2014not lost from the universe, since energy can never be created or destroyed, but irretrievably dispersed in the chaotic random thermal motions of molecules. At the same time, the atoms and molecules of the paper become dispersed and disordered. In the language of thermodynamics, there has been a loss of free energy; that is, of energy that can be harnessed to do work or drive chemical reactions. This loss reflects a reduction of orderliness in the way the energy and molecules were stored in the paper. We shall discuss free energy", "time it takes for the chemical change to occur. Bioenergetics makes use of a few basic ideas from the field of thermodynamics, particularly the concept of free energy. Because changes in free energy provide a measure of the energetic feasibility of a chemical reaction, they allow prediction of whether a reaction or process can take place. In short, bioenergetics predicts if a process is possible, whereas kinetics measures the reaction rate (see p. 54). II. FREE ENERGY The direction and extent to which a chemical reaction proceeds are determined by the degree to which two factors change during the reaction. These are enthalpy (\u2206H, a measure of the change [\u2206] in heat content of the reactants and products) and entropy (\u2206S, a measure of the change in randomness", "products of others, we should soon be able to calculate how the cell as a whole will behave, just as an astronomer can calculate the orbits of the planets, or a chemical engineer can calculate the flows through a chemical plant.

Equation 8\u20132 cannot answer this question. We need calculus. The most common strategy for solving this problem is to use ordinary differential equations. The equations that describe biochemical reactions have a simple premise: the rate of change in the concentration of any molecular species X (that is, d[X]/dt) is given by the balance of the rate of its appearance with that of its disappearance. For our example, the rate of change in the concentration of the bound promoter complex, [A:pX], is determined by the rates of complex assembly and disassembly.

In contrast, a gene that codes for a highly optimized essential protein or RNA molecule cannot alter so easily: when mistakes occur, the faulty cells are almost always eliminated.

While neither of the first two assumptions is a good description of human population history, study of this idealized case reveals the general principles in a clear and simple way. When a new neutral mutation occurs in a population of constant size N that is undergoing random mating, the probability that it will ultimately become fixed is approximately 1/(2N). This is because there are 2N copies of the gene in the diploid population, and each of them has an equal chance of becoming the predominant version in the long run. For those mutations that do become fixed, the mathematics shows that the average time to fixation is approximately 4N generations.

Different viruses use different strategies and gene repertoires to accomplish these goals. Most DNA viruses, except for poxviruses, replicate their nucleic acid and assemble into nucleocapsids in the cell nucleus. RNA viruses, except for influenza viruses, transcribe and replicate their RNA and assemble in the cytoplasm before envelopment at the cell plasma membrane. The replication strategies of DNA and RNA viruses and of positiveand negative-strand RNA viruses are presented and discussed separately below. Medically important viruses of each group are used for illustrative purposes. Positive-strand rna viruses RNA viruses of medical importance include positive-strand", "a template. For RNA viruses with a single-stranded genome, the replication strategy depends on whether the RNA is a positive [+] strand, which contains translatable information like mRNA, or a complementary negative [\u2013] strand. When the RNA is a positive [+] strand, the incoming viral genome is used to produce the viral RNA polymerase and viral proteins; the viral polymerase is then used to replicate the viral RNA and to generate mRNAs for the production of more viral proteins. For viruses with a negative [\u2013] strand RNA genome (such as influenza and measles virus), an RNA polymerase enzyme is packaged as a structural protein of the incoming viral capsids. Retroviruses such as HIV-1, which have a positive [+] strand RNA genome, are a special class of RNA virus", "some have a second option: they can propagate their genome as a quiet, well-behaved passenger in the host cell, replicating in parallel with the host cell\u2019s DNA (either integrated into the host genome, or as an extrachromosomal plasmid) in the course of ordinary cell-division cycles. These viruses will switch between two modes of existence according to circumstances, remaining latent and harmless for a long time, but then proliferating in occasional cells in a process that kills the host cell and generates large numbers of infectious particles. Neither of these conditions converts the host cell to a cancerous character, nor is it in the interest of the virus to do so. But for viruses with a latent phase, accidents can occur that prematurely activate some of the viral proteins", "infect target cells, and contains two copies of an RNA genome and numerous copies of viral enzymes that are required to establish infection in the cellular host. HIV is an example of a retrovirus, so named because the viral genome must be transcribed from RNA into DNA in the infected cell\u2014the reverse (retro) of the usual pattern of transcription\u2014by the viral reverse transcriptase enzyme. This generates a DNA intermediate that is integrated into the hostcell chromosomes to enable viral replication. RNA transcripts produced from the integrated viral DNA serve both as mRNAs to direct the synthesis of viral proteins and later as the RNA genomes of new viral particles.

Although this occurrence is unusual under most circumstances of natural infection, the genome changes can be substantial and can significantly alter virulence or epidemiology. Reassortment of the avian or mammalian influenza A hemagglutinin gene into a human influenza background can result in the emergence of new epidemic or pandemic influenza A strains. Viruses frequently have genes encoding proteins that are not directly involved in replication or packaging of the viral nucleic acid, in virion assembly, or in regulation of the transcription of viral genes involved in those processes. Most of these proteins fall into five classes: can be efficiently transcribed or translated; (3) proteins that promote cell survival or inhibit apoptosis so that progeny virus can mature and escape", "specific cell-surface proteins required for viral adsorption or penetration\u2014i.e., to the cell types that express receptors or co-receptors for a specific virus. Another common basis for host-range limitation is the degree of transcriptional activity from viral promoters in different cell types. Most DNA viruses depend not only on cellular RNA polymerase II and the basal components of the cellular transcription complex but also on activated components and transcriptional accessory factors, both of which differ among differentiated tissues, among cells at various phases of the cell cycle, and between resting and cycling cells. The importance of host range factors is illustrated by the effects of specific host determinants that limit the replication of influenza virus with avian or porcine hemagglutinins in humans. These viral proteins have adapted to bind", "after binding to one or more specific cell-surface receptors; the viral RNA and reverse transcriptase synthesize a double-strand DNA version of the RNA template; and the provirus moves into the nucleus and integrates into the host cell genome. This proviral integration is permanent. Although some animal retroviruses integrate into a single specific site of the host genome in every infected cell, the human retroviruses integrate randomly. This first phase of replication depends entirely on gene products in the virus. The second phase includes the synthesis and processing of viral genomes, mRNAs, and proteins using host cell machinery, often under the influence of viral gene products. Virions are assembled and released from the cell by budding from the membrane; host cell membrane proteins are frequently incorporated into the envelope", "their nucleic acids, which may be directly translated into viral proteins (positive-strand RNA viruses), transcribed from a negative strand of RNA into a complementary mRNA (negative-strand RNA viruses), or transcribed into a complementary strand of DNA (retroviruses); for DNA viruses, mRNA may be transcribed directly from viral DNA, either in the cell nucleus or in the cytoplasm. To grow, bacteria must acquire specific nutrients or synthesize them from precursors in host tissues. Many infectious processes are usually confined to specific epithelial surfaces\u2014e.g., H1 subtype influenza to the respiratory mucosa, gonorrhea to the urogenital epithelium, shigellosis to the gastrointestinal epithelium.

Cell diversification does not always depend on extracellular signals: in some cases, daughter cells are born different as a result of an asymmetric cell division, in which some important molecule or molecules are distributed unequally between the two daughters. This asymmetric inheritance ensures that the two daughter cells develop differently (Figure 21\u201312). Asymmetric division is a common feature of early development, where the fertilized egg already has an internal pattern and cleavage of this large cell segregates different determinants into separate blastomeres. We shall see that asymmetric division also plays a part in some later developmental processes.

We have already explained how maternal factors deposited in the developing frog egg define its animal-vegetal axis, and how cortical rotation triggered by fertilization defines the orientation of the dorsoventral axis (see Figure 21\u201314). But how does the establishment of axes lead on to the subdivision of the embryo into the future body parts? The maternal gene products lead to the formation of signaling centers on the vegetal and dorsal sides of the embryo. The dorsal signaling center in particular has a special place in the history of developmental biology. Experiments in the early twentieth century identified it as a small cluster of cells, located on the dorsal side of the amphibian embryo,", "characterized by the presence of two pronuclei and the extrusion of the second polar body (9,361,362). Embryos are examined again for cleavage after 24 to 30 hours of culture (9). The first embryo cleavage occurs approximately 21 hours after fertilization, and subsequent divisions occur every 12 to 15 hours up to the eight-cell stage on the 3rd day of embryo development (363). Compaction to form the 16-cell morula occurs on the 4th day of embryo development, and differentiation of the inner cell mass and trophectoderm to form a blastocyst (containing a \ufb02uid-filled area called a blastocele) is completed by the 5th or 6th day (364,365).

The discovery of this signaling center, called the Organizer, led the way to a pioneering analysis of the chain of inductive interactions that establish the framework of the vertebrate body.

Embryo Morphology Embryo morphology guides the choice of embryo for transfer. Pronuclear embryos are assessed by their distribution and number of nucleoli, the position of the second polar body relative to the first, and cleavage rates (abnormal rates are too fast, Cryopreservation of Embryos too slow, or arrested) (365).

Each newly synthesized organelle protein must find its way from a ribosome in the cytosol, where the protein is made, to the organelle where it functions.

Many chloroplast proteins, including the protein subunits of the photosynthetic system and of the ATP synthase (discussed in Chapter 14), are located in the thylakoid membrane.

Proteins imported into mitochondria are usually taken up from the cytosol within seconds or minutes of their release from ribosomes. Thus, in contrast to protein translocation into the ER, which often takes place simultaneously with translation by a ribosome docked on the rough ER membrane (described later), mitochondrial proteins are first fully synthesized as mitochondrial precursor proteins in the cytosol and then translocated into mitochondria by a post-translational mechanism. One or more signal sequences direct all mitochondrial precursor proteins to their appropriate mitochondrial subcompartment. Many proteins entering the matrix space contain a signal sequence at their N-terminus", "hydrophobic signal sequence that is unmasked when the first signal sequence is removed. In chloroplasts, import from the stroma into the thylakoid can occur by several routes, distinguished by the chaperones and energy source used. Peroxisomes differ from mitochondria and chloroplasts in many ways. Most notably, they are surrounded by only a single membrane, and they do not contain DNA or ribosomes. Thus, because peroxisomes lack a genome, all of their proteins are encoded in the nucleus. Peroxisomes acquire most of these proteins by selective import from the cytosol, although some of them enter the peroxisome membrane via the ER. Because we do not discuss peroxisomes elsewhere, we shall digress to consider some of the functions of this diverse family of organelles, before discussing their biosynthesis.

The pause also ensures that large portions of a protein that could fold into a compact structure are not made before reaching the translocator in the ER membrane. Thus, in contrast to the post-translational import of proteins into mitochondria and chloroplasts, chaperone proteins are not required to keep the", "divide and are distributed to the two daughter cells. Thus, each daughter cell inherits a complete set of specialized cell membranes from its mother. This inheritance is essential because a cell could not make such membranes from scratch. If the ER were completely removed from a cell, for example, how could the cell reconstruct it? As we discuss later, the membrane proteins that define the ER and perform many of its functions are themselves products of the ER. A new ER could not be made without an existing ER or, at least, a membrane that specifically contains the protein translocators required to import selected proteins into the ER from the cytosol (including the ER-specific translocators themselves). The same is true for mitochondria and plastids. Thus, it seems that", "compartments that are separate from the cytosol, thus creating functionally specialized aqueous spaces within the cell. In these spaces, subsets of molecules (proteins, reactants, ions) are concentrated to optimize the biochemical reactions in which they participate.

Each organelle membrane must also have a mechanism for importing, and incorporating into the organelle, the specific proteins that make the organelle unique.

REGULATION OF PROKARYOTIC GENE EXPRESSION In prokaryotes such as the bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli), regulation of gene expression occurs primarily at the level of transcription and, in general, is mediated by the binding of trans-acting proteins to cis-acting regulatory elements on their single DNA molecule (chromosome).

Because of this decoding, the information carried on mRNA relies on tRNA. Translation involves all three RNAs.

Because 64 codes are more than enough for 20 amino acids, most amino acids are coded by more than one codon. The start codon is AUG, which also corresponds to methionine; therefore, almost all proteins begin with this amino acid.

For example, many polymerase II promoters have a TATA box sequence, but those that do not typically have a \u201cstrong\u201d INR sequence.

Several spermatozoa may penetrate the zona pellucida, but only one spermatozoon completes the fertilization process. As the fertilizing spermatozoon penetrates the ooplasm, at least three types of postfusion reactions occur to prevent other spermatozoa from entering the secondary oocyte (polyspermy). These events include the following. \u0081 Fast block to polyspermy. A large and long-lasting (up to 1 minute) depolarization of the oolemma creates a transient electrical block to polyspermy. \u0081 Cortical reaction. Changes in the polarity of the oolemma then trigger release of Ca2 from the ooplasmic stores. The Ca2 propagates a cortical reaction wave in which cortical granules move to the surface and fuse with the oolemma, leading to a transient increase in surface area", "acrosome-intact sperm. Thus only one sperm usually enters the egg. Occasionally, more than one sperm does enter the egg. This results in a triploid cell that is unable to develop further. Therefore prevention of polyspermy is critical for normal development of the fertilized egg. Step 6: The entire sperm enters the egg during fusion. The flagellum and mitochondria disintegrate, so most of the mitochondrial DNA in cells is maternally derived. Once inside the egg, decondensation of the sperm DNA occurs. A membrane called the pronucleus forms around the sperm DNA as the newly activated egg completes the second meiotic division.

Step 5: The signaling cascade activates the exocytosis of enzyme-filled vesicles called cortical granules that reside in the outermost, or cortical, region of the unfertilized egg. The enzymes contained in the cortical granules are released to the outside of the egg upon exocytosis. These enzymes modify both ZP2 and ZP3 of the zona pellucida such that ZP2 can no longer bind acrosomereacted sperm, and ZP3 can no longer bind capacitated acrosome-intact sperm.

This involves digestion of the extracellular matrix of the cumulus by a membrane hyaluronidase, PH-20. Step 2: Penetration of the zona pellucida by the sperm. This involves binding of the sperm to the zona protein ZP3 (step 2a), which induces release of acrosomal enzymes (called the acrosomal reaction (step 2b). The sperm secondarily bind to another zona protein, ZP2 (step 2c), as the zona pellucida is digested and the sperm swims through to the egg (step 2d).

Fertilization As the capacitated sperm near and pass through cumulus cells surrounding the oocyte, hydrolytic enzymes are released from the acrosome via exocytosis in a process called the acrosome reaction. Both capacitation and the acrosome reaction can be induced in vitro (28,31). Following the acrosome reaction, the sperm binds to and penetrates the zona pellucida (the extracellular coat surrounding the oocyte). This allows the sperm to fuse with the plasma membrane of the oocyte, an event that promotes changes in the oocyte and prevent entry by additional sperm (31). As the first sperm penetrates the zona pellucida, cortical granules are released (the cortical reaction) from the oocyte into the perivitelline space.

Usually, only a few hundred of the millions of spermatozoa in an ejaculate reach the site of fertilization, typically the ampulla of the uterine tube. On arrival, spermatozoa are confronted with the secondary oocyte surrounded by the corona radiata. Spermatozoa must penetrate the corona radiata to gain access to the zona pellucida. Although several spermatozoa may penetrate the zona pellucida, only one spermatozoon completes the fertilization process. Capacitation is complete when spermatozoa are able to bind to the zona pellucida receptors. Binding to the ZP-3 receptors on the zona pellucida triggers the acrosome reaction in which enzymes (mainly hyaluronidases) released from the acrosome enable a single spermatozoon to penetrate the zona pellucida. Penetration is accomplished by limited proteolysis of the zona pellucida in front of the advancing", "the two pronuclei, the resulting zygote, with its diploid (2n) complement of 46 chromosomes, undergoes a mitotic division or first cleavage. This two-cell stage marks the beginning of embryonic development. Before spermatozoa can fertilize the secondary oocyte, they must acquire more thrust to penetrate the corona radiata and zona pellucida. When approaching a secondary oocyte, a spermatozoon becomes hyperactivated: It swims faster, and its tail movements become more forceful and erratic. Recent studies indicate that this hyperactivation reaction is caused by a sudden influx of Ca2 into the tails of spermatozoa.

Mitochondria and apoptosis The process of apoptosis (programmed cell death) may be initiated through the intrinsic (mitochondrial-mediated) pathway by the formation of pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane. These pores allow cytochrome c to leave the intermembrane space and enter the cytosol. There, cytochrome c, in association with proapoptotic factors, activates a family of proteolytic enzymes (the caspases), causing cleavage of key proteins and resulting in the morphologic and biochemical changes characteristic of apoptosis.

Plants of the pea family, for example, harbor symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria in nodules in their roots. Living cells therefore differ widely in some of the most basic aspects of their biochemistry. Not surprisingly, cells with complementary needs and capabilities have developed close associations. Some of these associations, as we see below, have evolved to the point where the partners have lost their separate identities altogether: they have joined forces to form a single composite cell. The Greatest Biochemical diversity exists Among Prokaryotic cells From simple microscopy, it has long been clear that living organisms can be classified on the basis of cell structure into two groups: the eukaryotes and the Figure 1\u201312", "which they could then use to produce ATP. Protons could leak back into the cell through the ATP-driven H+ pumps, essentially running them in reverse so that they synthesized ATP (stage 3 in Figure 14\u201355). Because such cells would require much less of the dwindling supply of fermentable nutrients, they would have proliferated at the expense of their neighbors. By providing an Inexhaustible Source of reducing power, photosynthetic Bacteria Overcame a Major Evolutionary Obstacle The gradual depletion of nutrients from the environment on the early Earth meant that organisms had to find some alternative source of carbon to make the sugars that serve as the precursors for so many other cell components.

Thus, the formation of ATP, NADPH, and O2 (which requires light energy directly) and the conversion of CO2 to carbohydrate (which requires light energy only indirectly) are separate processes (Figure 14\u201339). However, they are linked by elaborate feedback mechanisms that allow a plant to manufacture sugars only when it is appropriate to do so. Several of the chloroplast enzymes required for carbon fixation, for example, are inactive in the dark and reactivated by light-stimulated electron-transport processes.

Some of these cells might have used the nonfermentable organic acids that neighboring cells had excreted as waste to provide the electrons needed to feed this electron-transport system.

These techniques have also opened up many new possibilities in agriculture that could benefit both the farmer and the consumer.

We have thus far sketched the way in which the rudiment of a single body segment is constructed and how cells within each segment become different from one another.

The amounts added to or lost from the body can vary widely, depending on the environment, access to food and water, disease processes, and even cultural norms. In such an open system, homeostasis occurs through the process of steady-state balance. To illustrate the concept of steady-state balance, consider a river on which a dam is built to create a synthetic lake. Each day, water enters the lake from the various streams and rivers that feed it. In addition, water is added by underground springs, rain, and snow. At the same time, water is lost through the spillways of the dam and by the process of evaporation. For the level of the lake to remain constant (i.e., steady-state balance), the", "such acids lowered the pH of the environment, favoring the survival of cells that evolved transmembrane proteins that could pump H+ out of the cytosol, thereby preventing the cell from becoming too acidic (stage 1 in Figure 14\u201355). One of these pumps may have used the energy available from ATP hydrolysis to eject H+ from the cell; such a proton pump could have been the ancestor of present-day ATP synthases. As the Earth\u2019s supply of geochemically produced nutrients began to dwindle, organisms that could find a way to pump H+ without consuming ATP would have been at an advantage: they could save the small amounts of ATP they derived from the fermentation of increasingly scarce foodstuffs to fuel other important activities. This need to conserve resources might have", "which they could then use to produce ATP. Protons could leak back into the cell through the ATP-driven H+ pumps, essentially running them in reverse so that they synthesized ATP (stage 3 in Figure 14\u201355).

Thus no matter how much an enzyme speeds up a reaction, it cannot change its direction. Despite the above limitation, enzymes steer all of the reactions in cells through specific reaction paths. This is because enzymes are both highly selective and very precise, usually catalyzing only one particular reaction. In other words, each enzyme selectively lowers the activation energy of only one of the several possible chemical reactions that its bound substrate molecules could undergo. In this way, sets of enzymes can direct each of the many different molecules in a cell along a particular reaction pathway (Figure 2\u201324). The success of living organisms is attributable to a cell\u2019s ability to make enzymes of many", "concentration of substrate at which the reaction rate is half-maximal (Km) is a measure of how tightly the substrate is bound, with a large value of Km corresponding to weak binding. WHY ANALYZE THE KINETICS OF ENZYMES? Enzymes are the most selective and powerful catalysts known. An understanding of their detailed mechanisms provides a critical tool for the discovery of new drugs, for the large-scale industrial synthesis of useful chemicals, and for appreciating the chemistry of cells and organisms. A detailed study of the rates of the chemical reactions that are catalyzed by a purifed enzyme\u2014more specifcally how these rates change with changes in conditions such as the concentrations of substrates, products, inhibitors, and regulatory ligands\u2014allows biochemists to fgure out exactly how each enzyme works. For example, this", "energy for the reaction, and it is the major determinant of the reaction rate. Enzymes have a much higher affinity for the transition state of the substrate than they have for the stable form. rate of reaction Figure 3\u201346 enzyme kinetics. The rate of an enzyme reaction (V) increases as the substrate concentration increases until a maximum value (Vmax) is reached. At this point all substrate-binding sites on the enzyme molecules are fully occupied, and the rate of reaction is limited by the rate of the catalytic process on the enzyme surface. For most enzymes, the concentration of substrate at which the reaction rate is half-maximal (Km) is a measure of how tightly the substrate is bound, with a large value of Km corresponding to weak binding. WHY", "rate of reaction is determined by the number of such energized molecules. In general, the lower the Ea, the more molecules have sufficient energy to pass through the transition state and, therefore, the faster the rate of the reaction. 3. Alternate reaction pathway: An enzyme allows a reaction to proceed rapidly under conditions prevailing in the cell by providing an alternate reaction pathway with a lower Ea (see Fig. 5.4). The enzyme does not change the free energies of the reactants (substrates) or products and, therefore, does not change the equilibrium of the reaction (see p. 70). It does, however, accelerate the rate by which equilibrium is reached. B. Active site chemistry The active site is not a passive receptacle for binding the substrate but, rather, is a", "substrate that allows the reaction to proceed at one-half its maximum rate (0.5 Vmax) (see Figure 3\u201346). A low Km value means that the enzyme reaches its maximum catalytic rate at a low concentration of substrate and generally indicates that the enzyme binds to its substrate very tightly, whereas a high Km value corresponds to weak binding. The methods used to characterize enzymes in this way are explained in Panel 3\u20132 (pp. 142\u2013143). Enzymes achieve extremely high rates of chemical reaction\u2014rates that are far higher than for any synthetic catalysts. There are several reasons for this efficiency. First, when two molecules need to react, the enzyme greatly increases the local concentration of both of these substrate molecules at the catalytic site, holding them in the correct orientation for", "to enzyme and product. An enzyme allows a reaction to proceed rapidly under conditions prevailing in the cell by providing an alternate reaction pathway with a lower activation energy (Ea). Because the enzyme does not change the free energies of the reactants or products, it does not change the equilibrium of the reaction. Most enzymes show Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and a plot of the initial reaction velocity (vo) against substrate concentration ([S]) has a hyperbolic shape similar to the oxygen-dissociation curve of myoglobin. A Lineweaver-Burk plot of 1/v and 1/[S] allows determination of Vmax (maximal velocity) and Km (Michaelis constant, which reflects affinity for substrate). Any substance that can decrease the velocity of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is called an inhibitor. The two most common types of reversible inhibition are", "Study enzymes STEADY-STATE ENZYME KINETICS Many enzymes have only one substrate, which they bind and then process to produce products according to the scheme outlined in Figure 3\u201350A.

Velocity decrease with higher temperature: Further elevation of the temperature causes a decrease in reaction velocity as a result of temperature-induced denaturation of the enzyme (see Fig. 5.7). The optimum temperature for most human enzymes is between 35\u00b0C and 40\u00b0C.

We begin with transposition, as there are many more known examples of this type of movement. Through Transposition, Mobile Genetic Elements Can Insert Into Any DNA Sequence Mobile elements that move by way of transposition are called transposons, or transposable elements.

Some Viruses Use a Transposition Mechanism to Move Themselves Into Host-Cell Chromosomes Certain viruses are considered mobile genetic elements because they use transposition mechanisms to integrate their genomes into that of their host cell. However, unlike transposons, these viruses encode proteins that package their genetic information into virus particles that can infect other cells. Many of the viruses that insert themselves into a host chromosome do so by employing one of the first two mechanisms listed in Table 5\u20134; namely, by behaving like DNA-only transposons or like retroviral-like retrotransposons. Indeed, much of our knowledge of these mechanisms has come from studies of particular viruses", "has a key role as a template to generate the DNA recombination substrate; and (3) nonretroviral retrotransposons, in which an RNA copy of the element is central to the incorporation of the element into the target DNA, acting as a direct template for a DNA target-primed reverse transcription event. Intriguingly, different types of transposons predominate in different organisms. For example, the vast majority of bacterial transposons are DNA-only types, with a few related to the nonretroviral retrotransposons also present. In yeasts, the main mobile elements are retroviral-like retrotransposons. In Drosophila, DNA-based, retroviral, and nonretroviral transposons are all found. Finally, the human genome contains all three types of transposon, but as discussed below, their evolutionary histories are strikingly different. Genome Sequences Reveal the Approximate Times at Which Transposable Elements", "For example, the genes they carry are sometimes advantageous, as in the case of antibiotic resistance in bacterial cells, discussed below. The movement of mobile genetic elements also produces many of the genetic variants upon which evolution depends, because, in addition to moving themselves, mobile genetic elements occasionally rearrange neighboring sequences of the host genome. Thus, spontaneous mutations observed in Drosophila, humans, and other organisms are often due to the movement of mobile genetic elements. While many of these mutations will be deleterious to the organism, some will be advantageous and may spread throughout the population. It is almost certain that much of the variety of life we see around us originally arose from the movement of mobile genetic elements. In this section, we introduce mobile genetic elements", "are inexhaustible resources, which are widely shared among investigators. Today, many such libraries are also available from commercial sources. Because the identity of each insert in a library is often known (through sequencing the insert), it is often possible to order a particular region of a chromosome (or, in the case of cDNA, a complete, intron-less protein-coding gene) and have it delivered by mail. Cloning DNA by using bacteria revolutionized the study of genomes and is still in wide use today. However, there is an even simpler way to clone DNA, one that can be carried out entirely in vitro. We discuss this approach, called the polymerase chain reaction, below. However, first we need to review a fundamental, far-reaching property of DNA and RNA called hybridization.

One might have predicted that the information present in genomes would be arranged in an orderly fashion, resembling a dictionary or a telephone directory. But it turns out that the genomes of most multicellular organisms are surprisingly disorderly, reflecting their chaotic evolutionary histories. The genes in these organisms largely consist of a long string of alternating short exons and long introns, as discussed in Chapter 4 (see Figure 4\u201315D). Moreover, small bits of DNA sequence that code for protein are interspersed with large blocks of seemingly meaningless DNA.

Filopodia, formed by migrating growth cones of neurons and some types of fibroblasts, are essentially one-dimensional. They contain a core of long, bundled actin filaments, which are reminiscent of those in microvilli but longer and thinner, as well as more dynamic. Lamellipodia, formed by epithelial cells and fibroblasts, as well as by some neurons, are two-dimensional, sheetlike structures. They contain a cross-linked mesh of actin filaments, most of which lie in", "two contexts. Nevertheless, it is likely that the same basic principles apply. Both in vitro and in vivo, intracellular signals generated at cell\u2013matrix adhesion sites are crucial for cell proliferation and survival. Integrins recruit Intracellular Signaling proteins at Sites of Cell\u2013Matrix adhesion The mechanisms by which integrins signal into the cell interior are complex, involving several pathways, and integrins and conventional signaling receptors often influence one another and work together to regulate cell behavior, as we have already emphasized.

The Velcro principle, mentioned earlier in the context of cadherin adhesion (see Figure 19\u20136C), operates here too. Following their activation, integrins cluster together to create a dense plaque in which many integrin molecules are anchored to cytoskeletal filaments. The resulting protein structure can be remarkably large and complex, as seen in the focal adhesion made by a fibroblast on a fibronectin-coated surface culture dish. The assembly of mature cell\u2013matrix junctional complexes depends on the recruitment of dozens of different scaffolding and signaling proteins. Talin is a major component of many cell\u2013matrix complexes, but numerous other proteins also make important contributions. These include the integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and", "prominent, and durable. Examples of the latter are the focal adhesions that form when fibroblasts have sufficient time to establish strong attachments to the rigid surface of a culture dish, and the myotendinous junctions that attach muscle cells to their tendons.

One", "a complex of several different proteins, which together form a linkage to the cytoskeleton. For all but one of the 24 varieties of human integrins, this intracellular linkage is to actin filaments. These linkages depend on proteins that assemble at the short cytoplasmic tails of the integrin subunits (see Figure 19\u201355). A large adaptor protein called talin is a component of the linkage in many cases, but numerous additional proteins are also involved. Like the actin-linked cell\u2013cell junctions formed by cadherins, the actin-linked cell\u2013matrix junctions formed by integrins may be small, inconspicuous, and transient, or large, prominent, and durable.

Fimbrin has two directly adjacent actinbinding", "but cells often need both kinds of stimulation of this pathway at the same time to give sufficient activation to induce cell proliferation. Integrins and conventional signaling receptors also cooperate to promote cell survival (discussed in Chapters 15 and 18). One of the best-studied modes of integrin signaling depends on a cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase called focal adhesion kinase (FAK). In studies of cells cultured on plastic dishes, focal adhesions are often prominent sites of tyrosine phosphorylation (Figure 19\u201359), and FAK is one of the major tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins found at these sites. When integrins cluster at cell\u2013matrix contacts, FAK is recruited to the integrin \u03b2 subunit by intracellular adaptor proteins such as talin or paxillin (which binds to one type of integrin \u03b1 subunit).

As in lamel lipodia, these protrusions contain loose aggregations of 10 to 20 actin filaments organized in the same direction, again with their plus ends directed toward the plasma mem brane. Actin filaments are also essential in cytoplasmic streaming (i.e., the streamlike movement of cytoplasm that can be observed in cultured cells). Intermediate flaments play a supporting or general structural role. These ropelike filaments are called intermediate because their diameter of 8 to 10 nm is between those of actin filaments and microtubules. Nearly all intermediate filaments consist of subunits with a molecular weight of about 50 kDa.

The answer to this question depends on the functional consequences of the mutation. If the mutation has a significantly deleterious effect, it will simply be eliminated by purifying selection and will not become fixed.

Conversely, the rare mutations that confer a major reproductive advantage on individuals who inherit them can spread rapidly in the population.

In some animals, including humans, the survival of multiple, dependent offspring is beyond the capacity and resources of a single parent. In this situation, the presence of a long-lived grandmother who shares in the care of her grandchildren can have a major impact on their survival.

For those mutations that do become fixed, the mathematics shows that the average time to fixation is approximately 4N generations. Detailed analyses of data on human genetic variation have suggested an ancestral population size of approximately 10,000 at the time when the current pattern of genetic variation was largely established. With a population that has reached this size, the probability that a new, selectively neutral mutation would become fixed is small (1/20,000), while the average time to fixation would be on the order of 800,000 years (assuming a 20-year generation time).

By comparing the DNA sequences of individual human genomes, an intelligent visitor from outer space could deduce that humans reproduce sexually, even if it knew nothing about human behavior. Sexual reproduction is widespread (although not universal), especially among eukaryotes. Even bacteria indulge from time to time in controlled sexual exchanges of DNA with other members of their own species. Natural selection has clearly favored organisms that can reproduce sexually, although evolutionary theorists dispute precisely what that selective advantage is.

Just as in the evolution of plants and animals, a kind of speciation often occurs: the original cancer cell lineage can diversify to give many genetically different vigorous subclones of cells. These may coexist in the same mass of tumor tissue; or they may migrate and colonize separate environments suited to their individual quirks, where they settle, thrive, and progress as independently evolving metastases.

While neither of the first two assumptions is a good description of human population history, study of this idealized case reveals the general principles in a clear and simple way. When a new neutral mutation occurs in a population of constant size N that is undergoing random mating, the probability that it will ultimately become fixed is approximately 1/(2N). This is because there are 2N copies of the gene in the diploid population, and each of them has an equal chance of becoming the predominant version in the long run. For those mutations that do become fixed, the mathematics shows that the average time to fixation is approximately 4N generations. Detailed analyses of", "we saw earlier, they account for most of the DNA sequence differences between apes and humans. The spread of neutral mutations is not as rapid as the spread of the rare strongly advantageous mutations.

Through a sort of \u201crandom walk\u201d process, the mutant allele may eventually become extinct, or it may become commonplace.

The Lyon hypothesis also explains", "contains more than a thousand genes, whereas the Y chromosome is small and contains less than 100 genes. Mammals have evolved a dosage compensation mechanism to equalize the dosage of X-chromosome gene products between males and females. The correct ratio of X chromosome to auto-some (non-sex chromosome) gene products is carefully controlled, and mutations that interfere with this dosage compensation are generally lethal. Mammals achieve dosage compensation by the transcriptional inactivation of one of the two X chromosomes in female somatic cells, a process known as X-inactivation. As a result of X-inactivation, two X chromosomes can coexist within the same nucleus, exposed to the same diffusible transcription regulators, yet differ entirely in their expression.

Early in the development of a female embryo, when it consists of a few hundred cells, one of the two X chromosomes in each cell becomes highly condensed into a type of heterochromatin. The initial choice of which X chromosome to inactivate, the maternally inherited one (Xm) or the paternally inherited one (Xp), is random. Once either Xp or Xm has been inactivated, it remains silent throughout all subsequent cell divisions of that cell and its progeny, indicating that the inactive state is faithfully maintained through many cycles of DNA replication and mitosis. Because X-inactivation is random and takes place after several hundred cells have already formed in the embryo,", "Ushiki.) same shape and size). Twenty-two pairs have identical chromosomes (i.e., each chromosome of the pair contains the same portion of the genome) and are called autosomes. The twenty-third pair of chromosomes are the sex chromosomes, designated X and Y. Females contain two X chromosomes; males contain one X and one Y chromosome. The chromosomal number, 46, is found in most of the somatic cells of the body and is called the diploid (2n) number. To simplify the description of chromosomal number and DNA changes during mitosis and meiosis, we use the lower case letter (n) for chromosome number and lower case letter (d) for DNA content. Diploid chromosomes have the (2d) amount of DNA immediately after cell division but have twice that amount\u2014that is, the (4d) amount", "regions of less active transcription. The banded human karyotype has now been standardized based on an internationally agreed upon system for designating not only individual chromosomes but also chromosome regions, providing a way in which structural rearrangements and variants can be described in terms of their composition. The normal human female karyotype is referred to as 46,XX (46 chromosomes, with 22 pairs of autosomes and two of the same type of sex chromosomes [two Xs], indicating this is a female); and the normal human male karyotype is referred to as 46,XY (46 chromosomes, with 22 pairs of autosomes and one of each type of sex chromosome [one X and one Y], indicating this is a male). The anatomy of a chromosome includes the central constriction, known as the", "one active X chromosome. This phenomenon explains why normal females do not have a double dose (compared with males) of phenotypic attributes encoded on the X chromosome. The Lyon hypothesis also explains why normal females are in reality mosaics, containing two cell populations: one with an active maternal X, the other with an active paternal X. The molecular basis of X inactivation involves a long non\u2013coding RNA that is encoded by the XIST gene. This non\u2013coding RNA is retained in the nucleus, where it \u201ccoats\u201d the X chromosome that it is transcribed from and silences the genes on that chromosome. The other XIST allele is switched off in the active X, allowing genes encoded one one X chromosome to be expressed.

However, difficulties arise during gametogenesis, resulting in the formation of unbalanced gametes that could lead to abnormal offspring. \u2022 Isochromosomes result when the centromere divides horizontally rather than vertically. One of the two arms of the chromosome is then lost, and the remaining arm is duplicated, resulting in a chromosome with only two short arms or two long arms. The most common isochromosome present in live births involves the long arm of the X chromosome and is designated i(Xq).

Two interstitial breaks, with reunion of the proximal and distal segments, may result in loss of an internal segment.

Alpha diversity can be measured by plotting the number of different types of SSU rRNA sequences identified at a given phylogenetic level (species, genera, etc.) in a sample as a function of the number of SSU rRNA gene reads collected.

The answer to this question depends on the functional consequences of the mutation. If the mutation has a significantly deleterious effect, it will simply be eliminated by purifying selection and will not become fixed.

Conversely, the rare mutations that confer a major reproductive advantage on individuals who inherit them can spread rapidly in the population.

It can reproduce either vegetatively (that is, by simple cell division), or sexually: two yeast cells that are haploid (possessing a single copy of the genome) can fuse to create a cell that is diploid (containing a double genome); and the diploid cell can undergo meiosis (a reduction division) to produce cells that are once again haploid (Figure 1\u201337). In contrast with higher plants and animals, the yeast can divide indefinitely in either the haploid or the diploid state, and the process leading from one state", "necessary part of meiosis, which occurs in sexually reproducing organisms such as fungi, plants, and animals. Here, homologous recombination occurs as an integral part of the process whereby chromosomes are parceled out to germ cells (sperm and eggs in animals). We discuss the process of meiosis in detail in Chapter 17; in the following sections, we discuss how homologous recombination during meiosis produces chromosome crossing-over and gene conversion, resulting in hybrid chromosomes that contain genetic information from both the maternal and paternal homologs (Figure 5\u201353). Crossing-over and gene conversion are both generated by homologous recombination mechanisms that, at their core, resemble those used to repair double-strand breaks. Meiotic Recombination Begins with a Programmed Double-Strand Break Homologous recombination in meiosis starts with a bold stroke: a specialized protein (called", "is inherited from the mother. Underlying this law is the accurate parceling out of chromosomes to the germ cells (eggs and sperm) that takes place during meiosis. Thus, when a diploid cell in a parent undergoes meiosis to produce four haploid germ cells, exactly half of the genes distributed among these four cells should be maternal (genes inherited from the mother of this parent) and the other half paternal (genes inherited from the father of this parent). In some organisms (fungi, for example), it is possible to recover and analyze all four of the haploid gametes produced from a single cell by meiosis. Studies in such organisms have revealed rare cases in which the parceling out of genes violates the standard genetic rules. Occasionally, for example, meiosis yields", "by delivery to lysosomes, as discussed in Chapter 13). Because of these two processes, the mitochondrial inheritance in both animals and plants is uniparental. More precisely, the mitochondrial DNA passes from one generation to the next by maternal inheritance. In about two-thirds of higher plants, the chloroplast precursors from the male parent (contained in pollen grains) fail to enter the zygote, so that chloroplast as well as mitochondrial DNA is maternally inherited. In other plants, the chloroplast precursors from the pollen grains enter the zygote, making chloroplast inheritance biparental. In such plants, defective chloroplasts are a cause of variegation: a mixture of normal and defective chloroplasts in a zygote may sort out by mitotic segregation during plant growth and development, thereby producing alternating green and white patches in", "plants. Like their mitotic counterparts, duplicated meiotic prophase chromosomes first appear as long threadlike structures, in which the sister chromatids are so tightly glued together that they appear as one. It is during early prophase I that the homologs begin to associate along their length in a process called pairing, which, in some organisms at least, begins with interactions between complementary DNA sequences (called pairing sites) in the two homologs. As prophase progresses, the homologs become more closely juxtaposed, forming a four-chromatid structure called a bivalent (Figure 17\u201354A). In most species, homolog pairs are then locked together by homologous recombination: DNA double-strand breaks are formed at several locations in each sister chromatid, resulting in large numbers of DNA recombination events between the homologs (as described in Chapter 5).", "unit has been largely abandoned in chloroplasts. Polycistronic transcripts are cleaved into smaller fragments, which then require splicing or RNA editing to become functional. Organelle Genes are Maternally Inherited in animals and plants In Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker\u2019s yeast), when two haploid cells mate, they are equal in size and contribute equal amounts of mitochondrial DNA to the diploid zygote. Mitochondrial inheritance in yeasts is therefore biparental: both parents contribute equally to the mitochondrial gene pool of the progeny. However, during the course of the subsequent asexual, vegetative growth, the mitochondria become distributed more or less randomly to daughter cells. After a few generations, the mitochondria of any given cell contain only the DNA from one or the other parent cell, because only a small sample of the mitochondrial", "tolerate a small percentage of mismatched base pairs, and because of branch migration, they often extend for thousands of nucleotide pairs.

Because the myosin heads are arranged as mirror images on either side of the H band (antiparallel arrangement), this action pulls the thin filaments into the A band, thus shortening the sarcomere.

As in striated muscle, contraction is initiated by an increase in the Ca2 concentration in the cytosol, but the contraction does not act through a troponin\u2013tropomyosin complex on the thin filament. Rather, in smooth muscle, an increase in Ca2 concentration stimulates a myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) to phosphorylate one of the two regulatory light chains of the myosin molecule. The Ca2 binds to calmodulin to form the Ca2\u2013calmodulin complex, which in turn binds to MLCK to activate the phosphorylation reaction of the regulatory light chain of myosin (Fig. 11.23). When the light chain is phosphorylated, the actin-binding site of the myosin head is activated and attaches to actin.

To maintain efficiency and speed of muscle contraction, both thin and thick filaments in each myofibril must be aligned precisely and kept at an optimal distance from one another. Proteins known as accessory proteins are essential in regulating the spacing, attachment, and alignment of the myofilaments. These structural protein components of skeletal muscle fibrils constitute less than 25% of the total protein of the muscle fiber. They include the following (see also Fig. 11.7): \u0081 Titin, a large (2,500-kilodalton) protein, forms an elastic lattice that anchors thick filaments in the Z lines.

It forms filaments that run in the groove between the F-actin molecules in the thin filament. In resting muscle, tropomyosin and its regulatory protein, the troponin complex, mask the myosin-binding site on the actin molecule. Troponin consists of a complex of three globular subunits. Each tropomyosin molecule contains one troponin complex. Troponin-C (TnC) is the smallest subunit of the troponin complex (18 kilodaltons). It binds Ca2, the essential step in the initiation of contraction (see illustration that follows). Troponin-T (TnT), a 30-kilodalton subunit,", "(see page 316). The change in molecular conformation of TnC causes the TnI to dissociate from the actin molecules, allowing the troponin complex to uncover myosin-binding sites on the actin molecules. The myosin heads are now free to interact with actin molecules to initiate the muscle contraction cycle. Simultaneously, a Ca2-activated ATPase pump in the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum transports Ca2 back into the terminal cisternae. The resting concentration of Ca2 is restored in the cytosol in less than 30 milliseconds. This restoration of resting Ca2 concentration near the myo filaments normally causes contraction to stop.

The equilibration occurs in less time than the 0.75 seconds that the red blood cell spends in the capillary bed (capillary transit time). The diffusion of insoluble gases between alveolar gas and blood is considered perfusion limited because the partial pressure of gas in the blood leaving the capillary has reached equilibrium with alveolar gas and is limited only by the amount of blood perfusing the alveolus. In contrast, a gas that is diffusion limited, such as CO, has low solubility in the alveolar-capillary membrane but high solubility in blood because of its high affinity for hemoglobin (Hgb). These features prevent the equilibration of CO between alveolar gas and blood during the red blood", "blood because of their ability to bind to Hgb. However, their rate of equilibration is sufficiently rapid for complete equilibration to occur during the transit time of the red blood cell within the capillary. Equilibration for O2 and CO2 usually occurs within 0.25 seconds. Thus O2 and CO2 transfer is normally perfusion limited. The partial pressure of a gas that is diffusion limited (i.e., CO) does not reach equilibrium with the alveolar pressure over the time that it spends in the capillary ( Fig. 24.3 ). Although CO2 has a greater rate of diffusion in blood than O2 does, it has a lower membrane-blood solubility ratio and consequently takes approximately the same amount of time to reach equilibration in blood.

Fick\u2019s law of diffusion could be used to assess the diffusion properties of O2 in the lungs, except that the capillary partial pressure of oxygen cannot be measured. This limitation can be overcome with the use of carbon monoxide (CO) rather than O2. Because CO has low solubility in the capillary membrane, the rate of CO equilibrium across the capillary is slow, and the partial pressure of CO in capillary blood remains close to 0. In contrast, the solubility of CO in blood is high.

As increased ventilation supplies more anesthetic molecules to the alveolus, a more soluble anesthetic (blood:gas partition coefficient > 1) will traverse the alveolar capillary membrane more readily, preventing a rise in its alveolar partial pressure. Thus, increased ventilation will replenish the alveolar anesthetic concentration for a highly soluble anesthetic but is not necessary for an anesthetic with low solubility. Therefore, an increase in ventilation produces only a small change in alveolar partial pressure of an anesthetic with low blood solubility, but can significantly increase the partial pressure of agents with moderate to high blood solubility such as halothane. As seen in Figure 25\u20133, a fourfold increase in the ventilation rate almost doubles the FA/FI", "1 (representing inspired-toalveolar equilibrium), the faster anesthesia onset will be during an inhaled induction. The other parameter under control of the anesthesiologist that directly determines the rate of rise of FA/FI is alveolar ventilation. The anesthesiologist can increase the tidal volume and respiratory rate to deliver larger amounts of anesthetic agent faster. The magnitude of the effect is much greater for inhaled anesthetics with high blood solubility than for those with low blood solubility. The tendency for a given inhaled anesthetic to pass from the gas phase of the alveolus into the pulmonary capillary blood is determined by the blood:gas partition coefficient (see following section on Solubility and Table 25\u20131). As increased ventilation supplies more anesthetic molecules to the alveolus, a more soluble anesthetic (blood:gas partition coefficient >", "surface area available for diffusion and the amount of hemoglobin within the capillaries, and it varies inversely with alveolar membrane thickness.

The most common additional polymer in secondary walls is lignin, a complex network of covalently linked phenolic compounds found in the walls of the xylem vessels and fiber cells of woody tissues.

Restoration of the blood pH to its normal value requires correction of the underlying process or processes that produced the acid-base disorder. The body has three general mechanisms to defend against changes in body fluid pH produced by acid-base disturbances: (1) extracellular and intracellular buffering, (2) adjustments in blood PCO2 via alterations in the ventilatory rate of the lungs, and (3) adjustments in RNAE. The first line of defense against acid-base disorders is extracellular and intracellular buffering. The response of the extracellular buffers is virtually instantaneous, whereas the response to intracellular buffering is slower and can take several minutes. Metabolic disorders that result from addition of nonvolatile acid or alkali to body fluids are buffered in both the extracellular and intracellular", "in venous samples is approximately 6 mm Hg higher than arterial Pco2. The ratio of the serum bicarbonate concentration to Pco2 determines the pH. Capillary or venous samples should not be used to assess oxygenation. There are both respiratory and metabolic causes of acidosis (see Chapter 37). In the presence of an alkalosis or acidosis, respiratory compensation (altering Pco2 to maintain a normal pH) can occur within minutes, but renal compensation (altering the serum bicarbonate level) may not be complete for several days. Recall that both the respiratory and metabolic compensation are incomplete, so pH will remain on the side of the primary insult (whether acidosis or alkalosis).

In response to the associated volume deficit, aldosterone-mediated sodium reabsorption increases potassium excretion. The resulting hypo-kalemia leads to the excretion of hydrogen ions in the face of alkalosis, a paradoxic aciduria. Treatment includes replacement of the volume deficit with isotonic saline and then potassium replacement once adequate urine output is achieved.Respiratory Derangements.

Base excision repair DNA bases can be altered, either spontaneously, as is the case with cytosine, which slowly undergoes deamination (the loss of its amino group) to form uracil, or by the action of deaminating or alkylating compounds. For example, nitrous acid, which is formed by the cell from precursors such as the nitrates, deaminates cytosine, adenine (to hypoxanthine), and guanine (to xanthine). Dimethyl sulfate can alkylate (methylate) adenine. Bases can also be lost spontaneously. For example, ~10,000 purine bases are lost this way per cell per day.

Most of these problems are thought to arise from RNA polymerase molecules that become permanently stalled at sites of DNA damage that lie in important genes. The Chemistry of the DNA Bases Facilitates Damage Detection The DNA double helix seems optimal for repair. As noted above, it contains a backup copy of all genetic information. Equally importantly, the nature of the four bases in DNA makes the distinction between undamaged and damaged bases very clear. For example, every possible deamination event in DNA yields an \u201cunnatural\u201d base, which can be directly recognized and removed by a specific DNA glycosylase.

The first cells on the earth are thought to have been capable of neither photosynthesis nor respiration (discussed in Chapter 14). however, photosynthesis must have preceded respiration on the earth, since there is strong evidence", "for cells to evolve a new way of generating strong reducing agents. A major evolutionary breakthrough in energy metabolism came with the development of photochemical reaction centers that could use the energy of sunlight to produce molecules such as NADPH. It is thought that this occurred early in the process of cellular evolution in the ancestors of the green sulfur bacteria. Present-day green sulfur bacteria use light energy to transfer hydrogen atoms (as an electron plus a proton) from H2S to NADPH, thereby producing the strong reducing power required for carbon fixation. Because the redox potential of H2S is much lower than that of H2O (\u2013230 mV for H2S compared with +820 mV for H2O), one quantum of light absorbed by the single photosystem in these bacteria is", "what we do.

The universal presence of ATP synthase in bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts testifies to the central importance of chemiosmotic mechanisms in cells. All animals and most microorganisms rely on the continual uptake of large amounts of organic compounds from their environment. These compounds provide both the carbon-rich building blocks for biosynthesis and the metabolic energy for life. It is likely that the first organisms on the primitive Earth had access to an abundance of organic compounds produced by geochemical processes, but it is clear that these were used up billions of years ago. Since that time, virtually all of the organic materials required by living cells have been produced by", "evolution of a water-splitting enzyme and also required the addition of a second photosystem, acting in series with the first, to bridge the large gap in redox potential between H2O and NADPH. The biological consequences of this evolutionary step were far-reaching. For the first time, there would have been organisms that could survive on water, CO2, and sunlight (plus a few trace elements). These cells would have been able to spread and evolve in ways denied to the earlier photosynthetic bacteria, which needed H2S or organic acids as a source of electrons. Consequently, large amounts of biologically synthesized, reduced organic materials accumulated and oxygen entered the atmosphere for the first time. Oxygen is highly toxic because the oxidation of biological molecules alters their structure and properties indiscriminately and", "cell is therefore able to obtain energy from sugars or other organic molecules by allowing their carbon and hydrogen atoms to combine with oxygen to produce CO2 and H2O, respectively\u2014a process called aerobic respiration. Photosynthesis (discussed in detail in Chapter 14) and respiration are complementary processes (Figure 2\u201318). This means that the transactions between plants and animals are not all one way. Plants, animals, and microorganisms have existed together on this planet for so long that many of them have become an essential part of the others\u2019 environments. The oxygen released by photosynthesis is consumed in the combustion of organic molecules during aerobic respiration. And some of the CO2 molecules that are fixed today into organic molecules by photosynthesis in a green leaf were yesterday released into the", "the combustion of organic molecules during aerobic respiration. And some of the CO2 molecules that are fixed today into organic molecules by photosynthesis in a green leaf were yesterday released into the atmosphere by the respiration of an animal\u2014or by the respiration of a fungus or bacterium decomposing dead organic matter. We therefore see that carbon utilization forms a huge cycle that involves the biosphere (all of the living organisms on Earth) as a whole (Figure 2\u201319). Similarly, atoms of nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur move between the living and nonliving worlds in cycles that involve plants, animals, fungi, and bacteria. The cell does not oxidize organic molecules in one step, as occurs when organic material is burned in a fire. Through the use of enzyme catalysts, metabolism takes", "organic molecules of the living world by the photosynthetic activity of bacteria, algae, and plants. They pass to animals, microorganisms, and organic material in soil and oceans in cyclic paths.

The Z scheme first evolved in cyanobacteria to enable them to use water as a universally available electron source. Other, simpler photosynthetic bacteria have only one photosystem. As we shall see, they cannot use water as an electron source and must rely on other, more energy-rich substrates instead, from which electrons are more readily withdrawn.

Other drugs produce vasodilation by inhibiting specific phosphodiesterases, thereby interfering with the metabolic breakdown of cGMP. One such drug is sildenafil, used in treating erectile dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension (see Chapter 12).

However, for energy metabolism, the most important route of communication is chemical signaling between cells by blood-borne hormones or by neurotransmitters. C. Second messenger systems Hormones and neurotransmitters can be thought of as signals and their receptors as signal detectors. Receptors respond to a bound ligand by initiating a series of reactions that ultimately result in specific intracellular responses. Second messenger molecules, so named because they intervene between the original extracellular messenger (the neurotransmitter or hormone) and the ultimate intracellular effect, are part of the cascade of events that converts (transduces) ligand binding into a response. Two of the most widely recognized second messenger systems are the calcium/phosphatidylinositol system (see p. 205) and the adenylyl cyclase (adenylate cyclase)", "cells, and nerve endings, usually elicits an increase in phosphoinositol hydrolysis and an increase in inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and intracellular calcium.

Like the \u03b22 adrenoceptor, under certain circumstances the H2 receptor may couple to Gq, activating the IP3-DAG (inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-diacylglycerol) cascade. Activation of H3 receptors decreases transmitter release from histaminergic and other neurons, probably mediated by a decrease in calcium influx through N-type calcium channels in nerve endings.

Activation of muscarinic receptors also increases potassium flux across cardiac cell membranes (Figure 7\u20134A) and decreases it in ganglion and smooth muscle cells.

The \u03b21 and \u03b22 proteins have been much more extensively studied than has \u03b23, but it is thought that the proteins that make up all three types of \u03b2 receptors are similar, with seven membrane-spanning regions connected by intracellular and extracellular domains (see ).

Flowering involves a transformation of the behavior of the cells at the growing apex of the plant shoot\u2014the apical meristem.

In flowering, the meristem cells switch to making the components of a flower, with its sepals and petals, its stamens carrying pollen, and its ovary containing the female gametes. To time the switch correctly, the plant has to take account of both past and present conditions. One important cue, for many plants, is day length.

In general, these tests are not currently considered part of the standard assessment because their prognostic value and impact on management are limited by poor specificity, poor reproducibility, or controversies concerning the interpretation of the results (44,47,52).

The answer to this question depends on the functional consequences of the mutation. If the mutation has a significantly deleterious effect, it will simply be eliminated by purifying selection and will not become fixed. (In the most extreme case, the individual carrying the mutation will die without producing progeny.) Conversely, the rare mutations that confer a major reproductive advantage on individuals who inherit them can spread rapidly in the population.

While neither of the first two assumptions is a good description of human population history, study of this idealized case reveals the general principles in a clear and simple way. When a new neutral mutation occurs in a population of constant size N that is undergoing random mating, the probability that it will ultimately become fixed is approximately 1/(2N). This is because there are 2N copies of the gene in the diploid population, and each of them has an equal chance of becoming the predominant version in the long run. For those mutations that do become fixed, the mathematics shows that the average time to fixation is approximately 4N generations.

Sexual reproduction is widespread (although not universal), especially among eukaryotes. Even bacteria indulge from time to time in controlled sexual exchanges of DNA with other members of their own species. Natural selection has clearly favored organisms that can reproduce sexually, although evolutionary theorists dispute precisely what that selective advantage is.

It is easy to determine if a mutation is dominant or recessive. One simply mates a mutant with a wild type to obtain diploid cells or organisms.

As noted earlier, the origins of the embryonic axes and the three germ layers in the frog can be traced back to the blastula (see Figure 21\u20133A). By labeling individual blastomeres, we can track cells through all their divisions, transformations, and migrations and see what they become and where they come from. The precursors of ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm are arranged in order along the animal-vegetal axis of the blastula: the endoderm derives from the most vegetal blastomeres, the ectoderm from the most animal, and the mesoderm from a middle set.

Cell diversification does not always depend on extracellular signals: in some cases, daughter cells are born different as a result of an asymmetric cell division, in which some important molecule or molecules are distributed unequally between the two daughters. This asymmetric inheritance ensures that the two daughter cells develop differently (Figure 21\u201312). Asymmetric division is a common feature of early development, where the fertilized egg already has an internal pattern and cleavage of this large cell segregates different determinants into separate blastomeres.

Gradual accumulation of luid beween the morula cells leads to formation of the early blastocyst. As early as 4 to 5 days after fertilization, the 58-cell blastula diferentiates into ive embryo-producing cells-the inner cel mass (see Fig. 5-7). he remaining 53 outer cells, called the trophectoderm, are destined to form trophoblasts (Hertig, 1962).

The first embryo cleavage occurs approximately 21 hours after fertilization, and subsequent divisions occur every 12 to 15 hours up to the eight-cell stage on the 3rd day of embryo development (363). Compaction to form the 16-cell morula occurs on the 4th day of embryo development, and differentiation of the inner cell mass and trophectoderm to form a blastocyst (containing a \ufb02uid-filled area called a blastocele) is completed by the 5th or 6th day (364,365).

Here, however, nature has been unexpectedly kind to scientists. It is possible to take an early mouse embryo, at the blastocyst stage, and through cell culture to derive from it a class of stem cells called embryonic stem cells, or ES cells. These originate from the inner cell mass of the early embryo (the cluster of cells that give rise to the body of the embryo proper, as opposed to extraembryonic structures), and they have an extraordinary property: given suitable culture conditions, they will continue proliferating indefinitely and yet retain an unrestricted developmental potential.

The Gardner and Schoolcraft system for scoring blastocysts uses a scale from 1 (worst) to 6 (best), with grades 1 to 3 indicating growth of the blastocele until it completely fills the embryo. Grade 4 blastocysts are expanded with a larger blastocele volume and a thinning zona pellucida.

Conversely, the rare mutations that confer a major reproductive advantage on individuals who inherit them can spread rapidly in the population.

By comparing the DNA sequences of individual human genomes, an intelligent visitor from outer space could deduce that humans reproduce sexually, even if it knew nothing about human behavior. Sexual reproduction is widespread (although not universal), especially among eukaryotes. Even bacteria indulge from time to time in controlled sexual exchanges of DNA with other members of their own species. Natural selection has clearly favored organisms that can reproduce sexually, although evolutionary theorists dispute precisely what that selective advantage is.

The spread of neutral mutations is not as rapid as the spread of the rare strongly advantageous mutations. It depends on a random variation in the number of mutation-bearing progeny produced by each mutation-bearing individual, causing changes in the relative frequency of the mutant allele in the population. Through a sort of \u201crandom walk\u201d process, the mutant allele may eventually become extinct, or it may become commonplace.

When a eukaryotic cell divides, however, each daughter cell must also inherit all of the other essential cell components, including the membrane-enclosed organelles. As discussed in Chapter 12, organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts cannot be assembled de novo from their individual components; they can arise only by the growth and division of the preexisting organelles. Similarly, cells cannot make a new endoplasmic reticulum (ER) unless some part of it is already present. How, then, do the various membrane-enclosed organelles segregate when a cell divides? Organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts are usually present in large enough numbers to be safely inherited if, on average, their numbers roughly double once each cycle. The ER in", "phosphorylation. Chloroplasts, which occur only in plants and green algae, harness solar energy to produce ATP by photosynthesis. In electron micrographs, the most striking features of both mitochondria and chloroplasts are their extensive internal membrane systems. These internal membranes contain sets of membrane protein complexes that work together to produce most of the cell\u2019s ATP. In bacteria, simpler versions of essentially the same protein complexes produce ATP, but they are located in the cell\u2019s plasma membrane (Figure 14\u20131). Comparisons of DNA sequences indicate that the energy-converting organelles in present-day eukaryotes originated from prokaryotic cells that were endocytosed during the evolution of eukaryotes (discussed in Chapter 1). This explains why mitochondria and chloroplasts contain their own DNA, which still encodes a subset of their proteins. Over time, these organelles", "divide and are distributed to the two daughter cells. Thus, each daughter cell inherits a complete set of specialized cell membranes from its mother. This inheritance is essential because a cell could not make such membranes from scratch. If the ER were completely removed from a cell, for example, how could the cell reconstruct it? As we discuss later, the membrane proteins that define the ER and perform many of its functions are themselves products of the ER. A new ER could not be made without an existing ER or, at least, a membrane that specifically contains the protein translocators required to import selected proteins into the ER from the cytosol (including the ER-specific translocators themselves). The same is true for mitochondria and plastids. Thus, it seems that", "in and import from the cytoplasm simply too difficult and energy-consuming. It is also possible that the evolution (and eventual elimination) of the organellar genetic systems is still ongoing, but for now there is no alternative for the cell than to maintain separate genetic systems for its nuclear, mitochondrial, and chloroplast genes. Mitochondria are organelles that allow eukaryotes to carry out oxidative phosphorylation, while chloroplasts are organelles that allow plants to carry out photosynthesis. Presumably as a result of their prokaryotic origins, each organelle maintains and reproduces itself in a highly coordinated process that requires the contribution of two separate genetic systems\u2014one in the organelle and the other in the cell nucleus. The vast majority of the proteins in these organelles are encoded by nuclear DNA, synthesized in", "shape.

Because mitochondria generate ATP, they are more numerous in cells that use large amounts of energy such as striated muscle cells and cells engaged in \ufb02uid and electrolyte transport. Mitochondria also localize at sites in the cell where energy is needed, as in the middle piece of the sperm, the intermyofibrillar spaces in striated muscle cells, and adjacent to the basolateral plasma-membrane infoldings in the cells of the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney.

Incremental increases in afterload produce progressively higher peak systolic pressures. However, if the afterload continues to increase, it becomes so great that the ventricle can no longer generate enough force to open the aortic valve.

The picture is clearer, however, for more recent evolutionary events. Studies of both closely related animal populations and plant populations whose members have different morphologies have revealed that dramatic developmental effects can result from subtle changes in regulatory DNA. A well-studied example is the morphological diversity found in stickleback fish. After the last ice age ended about 10,000 years ago, marine sticklebacks colonized many newly formed freshwater streams and lakes. Marine sticklebacks extend sharp spines from their pelvic skeleton. These spines are thought to help protect the fish from soft-mouthed fish predators. In contrast, several populations of freshwater sticklebacks have lost these spines, usually in lakes that lack such predators.

The parts of this junctional complex depend on each other for their formation. For example, anticadherin antibodies that block the formation of adherens junctions also block the formation of tight junctions.

The first step is usually to translate in silico the entire genome into protein. There are six different reading frames for any piece of double-stranded DNA (three on each strand). We saw in Chapter 6 that a random sequence of nucleotides, read in frame, will PANeL 8\u20131: DNA Sequencing Methods OOCH25\u02dcOH3\u02dc3\u02dc3\u02dcOH allows strand extension at 3\u02dc end", "a chromosome (see figure 4\u201344). During the course of evolution, more than three out of every four CGs have been lost in this way, leaving vertebrates with a remarkable deficiency of this dinucleotide. The CG sequences that remain are very unevenly distributed in the genome; they are present at 10 times their average density in selected regions, called CG islands, which average 1000 nucleotide pairs in length. The human genome contains roughly 20,000 CG islands and they usually include promoters of genes. For example, 60% of human protein-coding genes have promoters embedded in CG islands and these include virtually all the promoters of the so-called housekeeping genes\u2014those genes that code for the many proteins that are essential for cell viability and are therefore expressed in nearly all cells", "costly, but no longer prohibitively so\u2014one can determine a tumor\u2019s complete genome sequence. More cheaply, one can focus just on the 21,000 or so genes in the human genome that code for protein (the so-called exome), looking for mutations in the cancer cell DNA that alter the amino acid sequence of the product or prevent its synthesis (Figure 20\u201323). There are also efficient techniques to survey the genome for regions that have undergone Figure 20\u201321 Six ways of losing the remaining good copy of a tumor suppressor gene through a change in DNA sequences.

Moreover, calculations based on population genetics reveal that just a tiny selective advantage\u2014less than a 0.1% difference in survival\u2014can be enough to strongly favor retaining a particular DNA sequence over evolutionary time spans. One should therefore not be surprised to find that many DNA sequences that are ultraconserved can be deleted from the mouse genome without any noticeable effect on that mouse in a laboratory. A second important approach for discovering the function of a mysterious noncoding DNA sequence uses biochemical techniques to identify proteins or RNA molecules that bind to it\u2014and/or to any RNA molecules that it produces. Most of this task still lies before us, but a start has been made (see p. 435).

In addition to the more common GH-secreting somatotrope adenomas, mixed mammosomatotrope tumors and acidophilic stem-cell adenomas secrete both GH and PRL.

Because this group is deprotonated at alkaline pH, the rate of the reaction declines. 2. pH effect on enzyme denaturation: Extremes of pH can also lead to denaturation of the enzyme, because the structure of the catalytically active protein molecule depends on the ionic character of the amino acid side chains. 3.

Rate accelerations range from 109 to 1023. Enzymes not only bind tightly to a transition state, they also contain precisely positioned atoms that alter the electron distributions in the atoms that participate directly in the making and breaking of covalent bonds. Peptide bonds, for example, can be hydrolyzed in the absence of an enzyme by exposing a polypeptide to either a strong acid or a strong base. Enzymes are unique, however, in being able to use acid and base catalysis simultaneously, because the rigid framework of the protein constrains the acidic and basic residues and prevents them from combining with each other, as they would do in solution (Figure 3\u201349). The fit between an enzyme and its substrate needs to", "energy for the reaction, and it is the major determinant of the reaction rate. Enzymes have a much higher affinity for the transition state of the substrate than they have for the stable form. rate of reaction Figure 3\u201346 enzyme kinetics. The rate of an enzyme reaction (V) increases as the substrate concentration increases until a maximum value (Vmax) is reached. At this point all substrate-binding sites on the enzyme molecules are fully occupied, and the rate of reaction is limited by the rate of the catalytic process on the enzyme surface. For most enzymes, the concentration of substrate at which the reaction rate is half-maximal (Km) is a measure of how tightly the substrate is bound, with a large value of Km corresponding to weak binding. WHY", "substrate that allows the reaction to proceed at one-half its maximum rate (0.5 Vmax) (see Figure 3\u201346). A low Km value means that the enzyme reaches its maximum catalytic rate at a low concentration of substrate and generally indicates that the enzyme binds to its substrate very tightly, whereas a high Km value corresponds to weak binding. The methods used to characterize enzymes in this way are explained in Panel 3\u20132 (pp. 142\u2013143). Enzymes achieve extremely high rates of chemical reaction\u2014rates that are far higher than for any synthetic catalysts. There are several reasons for this efficiency.

X. CHAPTER SUMMARY Enzymes are protein catalysts that increase the velocity of a chemical reaction by lowering the energy of the transition state (Fig. 5.23). They are not consumed during the reaction. Enzyme molecules contain a special cleft called the active site, which contains amino acid side chains that participate in substrate binding and catalysis. The active site binds the substrate, forming an enzyme\u2013substrate (ES) complex. Binding is thought to cause a conformational change in the enzyme (induced fit) that allows catalysis. ES is converted to enzyme and product. An enzyme allows a reaction to proceed rapidly under conditions prevailing in the cell by providing an alternate reaction pathway with a lower activation energy (Ea). Because the", "efficiency. First, when two molecules need to react, the enzyme greatly increases the local concentration of both of these substrate molecules at the catalytic site, holding them in the correct orientation for the reaction that is to follow. More importantly, however, some of the binding energy contributes directly to the catalysis. Substrate molecules must pass through a series of intermediate states of altered geometry and electron distribution before they form the ultimate products of the reaction. The free energy required to attain the most unstable intermediate state, called the transition state, is known as the activation energy for the reaction, and it is the major determinant of the reaction rate. Enzymes have a much higher affinity for the transition state of the substrate than they have for the", "enzyme, and the equilibrium point for the reaction will be unchanged (Figure 2\u201323). Thus no matter how much an enzyme speeds up a reaction, it cannot change its direction. Despite the above limitation, enzymes steer all of the reactions in cells through specific reaction paths. This is because enzymes are both highly selective and very precise, usually catalyzing only one particular reaction. In other words, each enzyme selectively lowers the activation energy of only one of the several possible chemical reactions that its bound substrate molecules could undergo. In this way, sets of enzymes can direct each of the many different molecules in a cell along a particular reaction pathway (Figure 2\u201324). The success of living organisms is attributable to a cell\u2019s ability to make enzymes of many", "break covalent bonds in a controlled way. It is the catalysis of organized sets of chemical reactions by enzymes that creates and maintains the cell, making life possible. We can group enzymes into functional classes that perform similar chemical reactions (Table 3\u20131). Each type of enzyme within such a class is highly specific, Figure 3\u201345 Small changes in the number of weak bonds can have drastic effects on a binding interaction. This example illustrates the dramatic effect of the presence or absence of a few weak noncovalent bonds in a biological context.

In Chapter 3, we discuss further how enzymes work. how enzymes find Their substrates: The enormous Rapidity of molecular motions An enzyme will often catalyze the reaction of thousands of substrate molecules every second. This means that it must be able to bind a new substrate molecule in a fraction of a millisecond. But both enzymes and their substrates are present in relatively small numbers in a cell. How do they find each other so fast? Rapid binding is possible because the motions caused by heat energy are enormously fast at the molecular level.

Unlike genomic DNA clones, cDNA clones lack intron sequences, making them the clones of choice for analyzing the protein product of a gene. Nucleic acid hybridization reactions provide a sensitive means of detecting any nucleotide sequence of interest. The enormous specificity of this hybridization reaction allows any single-stranded sequence of nucleotides to be labeled with a radioisotope or chemical and used as a probe to find a complementary partner strand, even in a cell or cell extract that contains millions of different DNA and RNA sequences. DNA hybridization also makes it possible to use PCR to amplify any section of any genome once its sequence is known. direction of electrophoresis Figure 8\u201342 Production of large amounts of a protein by using a plasmid expression vector.

A probe is a small piece of RNA or single-stranded DNA (usually labeled with a radioisotope, such as 32P, or another identifiable compound, such as biotin or a fluorescent dye) that has a nucleotide sequence complementary to the DNA molecule of interest (target DNA). Probes can be used to identify which clone of a library or which band on a gel contains the target DNA. Southern blotting is a technique that can be used to detect specific sequences present in DNA.

Southern blotting refers to the technique of transferring DNA fragments from an electropho-resis gel to a membrane support and the subsequent analysis of the fragments by hybridization with a radioactively or chemi-luminescently labeled probe (Fig. 15-16).26 Southern blotting is named after E. M. Southern, who in 1975 first described the technique of DNA analysis. It enables reliable and efficient analysis of size-fractionated DNA fragments in an immobilized membrane support. Southern blotting is composed of several steps. It normally begins with the digestion of the DNA samples with appropriate restriction enzymes,", "more slowly than the smaller ones, the lengths of the fragments, usually expressed as the number of base pairs, can be calculated from comparison of the position of the band relative to standard fragments of known size.] The DNA fragments in the gel are denatured and transferred (blotted) to a nitrocellulose membrane for analysis. If the original DNA represents the individual\u2019s entire genome, the enzymic digest contains \u2265106 fragments. The gene of interest is on only one (or a few if the gene itself was fragmented) of these pieces of DNA. If all the DNA fragments were visualized by a nonspecific technique, they would appear as an unresolved blur of overlapping bands.

SOUTHERN BLOTTING Southern blotting is a technique that combines the use of restriction enzymes, electrophoresis, and DNA probes to generate, separate, and detect pieces of DNA. A. Procedure This method, named after its inventor, Edward Southern, involves the following steps (Fig. 34.13). First, DNA is extracted from cells, for example, a patient\u2019s WBC. Second, the DNA is cleaved into many fragments using a restriction enzyme. Third, the resulting fragments (all of which are negatively charged) are separated on the basis of size by electrophoresis. [Note: Because the large fragments move more slowly than the smaller ones, the lengths of the fragments, usually expressed as the number of base pairs, can be calculated from comparison of the position of the band relative to", "then is treated so the DNA fragments are denatured (i.e., strand separation). The DNA then is transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane by capillary diffusion or under electricity. After immobilization, the DNA can be subjected to hybridization analysis, enabling bands with sequence similarity to a radioactively or chemilumi-nescently labeled probe to be identified.The development of Southern transfer and the associated hybridization techniques made it possible for the first time to obtain information about the physical organization of single and multicopy sequences in complex genomes. The later applica-tion of Southern blotting hybridization to the study of restriction fragment length polymorphisms opened up new possibilities DNA is digested withrestriction enzymes.DNA fragments are denaturedand separated by gelelectrophoresis.DNA fragments are transferredto a membrane filter.The filter is hybridized with a radioactive DNA probe.DNA fragment", "to points of the compass.] B. Mutation detection Southern blotting can detect DNA mutations such as large insertions or deletions, trinucleotide repeat expansions, and rearrangements of nucleotides. It can also detect point mutations (replacement of one nucleotide by another; see p. 449) that cause the loss or gain of restriction sites. Such mutations cause the pattern of bands to differ from those seen with a normal gene. Longer fragments are generated if a restriction site is lost. For example, in Figure 34.13, person 2 lacks a restriction site present in person 1. Alternatively, the point mutation may create a new cleavage site with the production of shorter fragments. [Note: Most sequence differences at restriction sites are harmless variations in the DNA.] VI.

Because TSH is a sensitive indicator of thyroid function, it is generally recommended as a first-line test for thyroid disorders. An elevated TSH level is almost always the result of primary hypothyroidism, whereas a low TSH is most often caused by thyrotoxicosis. These predictions can be confirmed by determining the free thyroxine level.

Negative reinforcement usually decreases the frequency of a behavior by removal, cessation, or avoidance of an unpleasant event.

Conversely, the rare mutations that confer a major reproductive advantage on individuals who inherit them can spread rapidly in the population.

Sexual cues are dependent on adequate neuroendocrine function. Multiple neurotransmitters, peptides, and hormones modulate desire and subjective arousal (9).

Cyanobacteria produced both abundant organic nutrients and molecular oxygen, enabling the rise of a multitude of aerobic life-forms.

The same allergens that cause allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis commonly cause asthma attacks. For example, respiratory arrest caused by severe attacks of asthma in the summer or autumn has been associated with the inhalation of Alternaria spores. Chronic allergen exposure leads to an important feature of asthma, namely, chronic inflammation of the airways, which is characterized by the continued presence of increased numbers of pathologic lymphocytes, eosinophils, neutrophils, basophils, and other leukocytes (Fig. 14.13).

However, many inflammatory cells are involved in asthma with no key cell that is predominant (Fig. 309-3). MAST CELLS Mast cells are important in initiating the acute bronchoconstrictor responses to allergens and several other indirectly acting stimuli, such as exercise and hyperventilation (via osmolality changes), as well as fog.

Many pathways and mechanisms other than production of IgE and activation of mast cell degranulation are involved in asthma\u2019s pathogenesis (Figure 20\u20132), and most asthma attacks are not triggered by inhalation of allergens, but instead by viral respiratory infections. Asthmatic bronchospasm can also be provoked by nonallergenic stimuli such as distilled water aerosol, exercise, cold air, cigarette smoke, and sulfur dioxide.

If no improvement is noted after the first four puffs, additional treatments should be taken while on the way to an emergency department or other higher level of care.

The germ cells transmit genetic information from parent to offspring; the somatic cells form the body of the organism (Figure 5\u20131).

Many Membrane proteins Diffuse in the plane of the Membrane Like most membrane lipids, membrane proteins do not tumble (flip-flop) across the lipid bilayer, but they do rotate about an axis perpendicular to the plane of the bilayer (rotational diffusion). In addition, many membrane proteins are able to move laterally within the membrane (lateral diffusion).

Membrane proteins Often Function as large complexes Many membrane proteins function as part of multicomponent complexes, several of which have been studied by x-ray crystallography. One is a bacterial photosynthetic reaction center, which was the first membrane protein complex to be crystallized and analyzed by x-ray diffraction. In Chapter 14, we discuss how such photosynthetic complexes function to capture light energy and use it to pump H+ across the membrane. Many of the membrane protein complexes involved in photosynthesis, proton pumping, and electron transport are even larger than the photosynthetic reaction center.

Both gap junctions and porins, the channels in the outer membranes of bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts (discussed in Chapter 10), have relatively large and permissive pores, and it would be disastrous if they directly connected the inside of a cell to an extracellular space. Indeed, many bacterial toxins do exactly that to kill other cells (discussed in Chapter 24). In contrast, most channels in the plasma membrane of animal and plant cells that connect the cytosol to the cell exterior necessarily have narrow, highly selective pores that can open and close rapidly.

We have already discussed how bacteriorhodopsin molecules in the purple membrane of Halobacterium assemble into large two-dimensional crystals, in which individual protein molecules are relatively fixed in relationship to one another (see Figure 10\u201330).

It is especially difficult to imagine how protein synthesis evolved because it is now performed by a complex interlocking system of protein and RNA molecules; obviously the proteins could not have existed until an early version of the translation apparatus was already in place. As attractive as the RNA world idea is for envisioning early life, it does not explain how the modern-day system of protein synthesis arose. Although we can only speculate on the origins of the genetic code, several experimental observations have provided plausible scenarios.

Transport may be enhanced by cell wall-active drugs such as penicillin or vancomycin; this enhancement may be the basis of the synergism of those antibiotics with aminoglycosides. Inside the cell, aminoglycosides bind to 30S-subunit ribosomal proteins. Protein synthesis is inhibited by aminoglycosides in at least three ways (Figure 45\u20133): (1) interference with the initiation complex of peptide formation; (2) misreading of mRNA, which NH2 causes incorporation of incorrect amino acids into the peptide and C NH results in a nonfunctional protein; and (3) breakup of polysomes into nonfunctional monosomes. These activities occur more or less simultaneously, and the overall effect is irreversible and leads to cell death. C. Mechanisms of Resistance Three principal mechanisms of resistance have been established: (1) production of a transferase", "causes, plus initiation of bisphosphonate or denosumab therapy as primary treatment. Antimicrobial agents provide some of the most dramatic examples of the advances of modern medicine. Many infectious diseases once considered incurable and potentially lethal can now be treated effectively with antibiotics. The remarkably powerful and specific activity of antimicrobial drugs is due to their selectivity for targets that are either unique to prokaryote and fungal microorganisms or much more important in these organisms than in humans. Among these targets are bacterial and fungal cell wall-synthesizing enzymes (Chapters 43 and 48), the bacterial ribosome (Chapters 44 and 45), the enzymes required for nucleotide synthesis and DNA replication (Chapter 46), and the machinery of viral replication (Chapter 49).

The special group of drugs used in mycobacterial infections is discussed in Chapter 47. Cytotoxic antiseptics and disinfectants are discussed in Chapter 50. The clinical uses of many antimicrobial agents are summarized in Chapter 51. The major problem threatening the continued success of antimicrobial drugs is the development of resistant organisms. Antibiotic resistance mechanisms existed long before the clinical use of antibiotics, even resistance to synthetic drugs that were created in the 20th century. Because resistance mechanisms are already present in nature, an inevitable consequence of antimicrobial use is the selection of resistant microorganisms. Since the start of the antibiotic era, antibiotic use in patients and animals", "requires time delays each time a new amino acid is added to a growing polypeptide chain, producing an overall speed of translation of 20 amino acids incorporated per second in bacteria. Mutant bacteria with a specific alteration in the small ribosomal subunit have longer delays and translate mRNA into protein with an accuracy considerably higher than this; however, protein synthesis is so slow in these mutants that the bacteria are barely able to survive. We have also seen that attaining the observed accuracy of protein synthesis requires the expenditure of a great deal of free energy; this is expected, since, as discussed in Chapter 2, there is a price to be paid for any increase in order in the cell. In most cells, protein synthesis consumes more energy", "preventing chain growth beyond three nucleotides (Fig. 31.10). Rifampin is important in the treatment of tuberculosis. Dactinomycin (actinomycin D) was the first antibiotic to find therapeutic application in tumor chemotherapy. It inserts (intercalates) between the DNA bases and inhibits transcription initiation and elongation. IV. EUKARYOTIC GENE TRANSCRIPTION The transcription of eukaryotic genes is a far more complicated process than transcription in prokaryotes. Eukaryotic transcription involves separate polymerases for the synthesis of rRNA, tRNA, and mRNA. In addition, a large number of proteins called transcription factors (TF) are involved. TF bind to distinct sites on the DNA within the core promoter region, close (proximal) to it, or some distance away (distal).

Each chromosome has undergone multiple rounds of replication, and the homologs and all their duplicates have remained in exact register with each other, resulting in huge chromatin cables many DNA strands thick. The four polytene chromosomes are normally linked together by heterochromatic regions near their centromeres that aggregate to create a single large chromocenter (pink region).

Further insight has come from another unusual class of cells\u2014the polytene cells of flies, such as the fruit fly Drosophila. Some types of cells, in many organisms, grow abnormally large through multiple cycles of DNA synthesis without cell division. Such cells, containing increased numbers of standard chromosomes, are said to be polyploid. In the salivary glands of fly larvae, this process is taken to an extreme degree, creating huge cells that contain hundreds or thousands of copies of the Figure 4\u201347 lampbrush chromosomes.

There Are multiple Forms of Chromatin By staining Drosophila polytene chromosomes with antibodies, or by using a more recent technique called ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) analysis (see Chapter 8), the locations of the histone and non-histone proteins in chromatin can be mapped across the entire DNA sequence of an organism\u2019s genome.

These experiments and others suggest that the DNA in human chromosomes is likely to be organized into loops of various lengths. A typical loop might contain between 50,000 and 200,000 nucleotide pairs of DNA, although loops of a million nucleotide pairs have also been suggested (Figure 4\u201349).

Puromycin is especially interesting because it is a structural analog of a tRNA molecule linked to an amino acid and is therefore another example of molecular mimicry; the ribosome mistakes it for an authentic amino acid and covalently incorporates it at the C-terminus of the growing peptide chain, thereby causing the premature termination and release of the polypeptide.

As indicated in Figure 1\u201329, recent genomic analyses suggest that the first eukaryotic cells formed after an archaeal cell engulfed an aerobic bacterium. This would explain why all eukaryotic cells today, including those that live as strict anaerobes show clear evidence that they once contained mitochondria. Many eukaryotic cells\u2014specifically, those of plants and algae\u2014also contain another class of small membrane-enclosed organelles somewhat similar to mitochondria\u2014the chloroplasts (Figure 1\u201330). Chloroplasts perform photosynthesis, using the energy of sunlight to synthesize carbohydrates from atmospheric carbon dioxide and water, and deliver the products to the host cell as food. Like mitochondria, chloroplasts have their own genome. They almost certainly originated as symbiotic photosynthetic bacteria, acquired by eukaryotic cells that already possessed mitochondria (Figure 1\u201331).", "DNA also contains many genes specifying proteins required in chloroplasts. In both cases, the DNA sequences of these nuclear genes show clear evidence of their origin from the bacterial ancestor of the respective organelle. Natural selection has evidently favored mitochondria with small genomes. By contrast, the nuclear genomes of most eukaryotes seem to have been free to enlarge. Perhaps the eukaryotic way of life has made large size an advantage: predators typically need to be bigger than their prey, and cell size generally increases in proportion to genome size. Whatever the reason, aided by a massive accumulation of DNA segments derived from parasitic transposable elements (discussed in Chapter 5), the genomes of most eukaryotes have become orders of magnitude larger than those of bacteria and archaea (Figure 1\u201332).", "the plant and animal lineages diverged, through endocytosis of an oxygen-producing cyanobacterium. This endosymbiont hypothesis of organelle development receives strong support from the observation that the genetic systems of mitochondria and chloroplasts are similar to those of present-day bacteria. For example, chloroplast ribosomes are very similar to bacterial ribosomes, both in their structure and in their sensitivity to various antibiotics (such as chloramphenicol, streptomycin, erythromycin, and tetracyclin). In addition, protein synthesis in chloroplasts starts with N-formylmethionine, as in bacteria, and not with methionine as in the cytosol of eukaryotic cells. Although mitochondrial genetic systems are much less similar to those of present-day bacteria than are the genetic systems of chloroplasts, their ribosomes are also sensitive to antibacterial antibiotics, and protein synthesis in mitochondria also starts with N-formylmethionine.

In yeast mitochondria, the number is 10; in bacteria and archaea, it ranges from 11 to 13; in plant chloroplasts, there are 14; and the rings of some cyanobacteria contain 15 c subunits. The c subunits in the rotor ring can be thought of as cogs in the gears of a bicycle. A high gear, with a small number of cogs, is advantageous when the supply of protons is limited, as in mitochondria, but a low gear, with a large number of cogs in the wheel, is preferable when the proton gradient is high.

The backflow of protons through the chloroplast ATP synthase then generates ATP. This ATP is used in conjunction with the NADPH produced by photosynthesis to drive a large number of biosynthetic reactions in the chloroplast stroma, including the carbon-fixation cycle, which generates large amounts of carbohydrates from CO2. In the early evolution of life, cyanobacteria overcame a major obstacle in devising a way to use solar energy to split water and fix carbon dioxide. Cyanobacteria produced both abundant organic nutrients and molecular oxygen, enabling the rise of a multitude of aerobic life-forms. The chloroplasts in plants have evolved from a cyanobacterium that was endocytosed long ago by an aerobic eukaryotic host organism.

In bacteria, simpler versions of essentially the same protein complexes produce ATP, but they are located in the cell\u2019s plasma membrane (Figure 14\u20131). Comparisons of DNA sequences indicate that the energy-converting organelles in present-day eukaryotes originated from prokaryotic cells that were endocytosed during the evolution of eukaryotes (discussed in Chapter 1).

Therefore, each domain has the characteristics of a small, compact globular protein that is structurally independent of the other domains in the polypeptide chain. B. Stabilizing interactions The unique three-dimensional structure of each polypeptide is determined by its amino acid sequence. Interactions between the amino acid side chains guide the folding of the polypeptide to form a compact structure. The following four types of interactions cooperate in stabilizing the tertiary structures of globular proteins. 1. Disulfide bonds: A disulfide bond (\u2013S\u2013S\u2013) is a covalent linkage formed from the sulfhydryl group (\u2212SH) of each of two cysteine residues to produce a cystine residue (Fig. 2.9).

Therefore, direct protein sequencing is an extremely important tool for determining the true character of the primary sequence of many polypeptides. III. SECONDARY STRUCTURE The polypeptide backbone does not assume a random three-dimensional structure but, instead, generally forms regular arrangements of amino acids that are located near each other in the linear sequence. These arrangements are termed the secondary structure of the polypeptide. The \u03b1-helix, \u03b2-sheet, and \u03b2bend (or, \u03b2-turn) are examples of secondary structures commonly encountered in proteins.", "As these examples illustrate, the central core of a domain can be constructed from \u03b1 helices, from \u03b2 sheets, or from various combinations of these two fundamental folding elements.

The two cysteines may be separated from each other by many amino acids in the primary sequence of a polypeptide or may even be located on two different polypeptides. The folding of the polypeptide(s) brings the cysteine residues into proximity and permits covalent bonding of their side chains. A disulfide bond contributes to the stability of the three-dimensional shape of the protein molecule and prevents it from becoming denatured in the extracellular environment. For example, many disulfide bonds are found in proteins such as immunoglobulins that are secreted by cells. [Note: Protein disulfide isomerase breaks and reforms disulfide bonds during folding.] 2. Hydrophobic interactions: Amino acids with nonpolar side chains tend", "(although they are limited by the size and character of the R groups). This allows the polypeptide chain to assume a variety of possible conformations. The peptide bond is almost always in the trans configuration (instead of the cis; see Fig. 2.2B), in large part because of steric interference of the R groups (side chains) when in the cis position. 3. Peptide bond polarity: Like all amide linkages, the \u2212C = O and \u2212NH groups of the peptide bond are uncharged, and neither accept nor release protons over the pH range of 2\u201312.

H1 is not found in the nucleosome core, but instead binds to the linker DNA chain between the nucleosome beads. H1 is the most tissue specific and species specific of the histones.

Typical present-day eukaryotic cells are 10\u201330 times larger in linear dimension and 1000\u201310,000 times greater in volume than a typical bacterium such as E. coli. The profusion of internal membranes can be regarded, in part, as an adaptation to this increase in size: the eukaryotic cell has a much smaller ratio of surface area to volume, and its plasma membrane therefore presumably has too small an area to sustain the many vital functions that membranes perform. The extensive internal membrane systems of a eukaryotic cell alleviate this problem. The evolution of internal membranes evidently went hand-in-hand with the specialization of membrane function. A hypothetical scheme for how", "Membrane The recognition that biological membranes are two-dimensional fluids was a major advance in understanding membrane structure and function.

We can think of the membrane lipids as constituting a two-dimensional solvent for the proteins in the membrane, just as water constitutes a three-dimensional solvent for proteins in an aqueous solution: some membrane proteins can function only in the presence of specific lipid head groups, just as many enzymes in aqueous solution require a particular ion for activity.

Early in cellular evolution, strong reducing agents (electron donors) are thought to have been plentiful.

Some present-day purple photosynthetic bacteria can switch between photosynthesis and respiration depending on the availability of light and O2, with only relatively minor reorganizations of their electron-transport chains.

AVP must be absent; without it the collecting duct does not reabsorb a significant amount of water. 2. The tubular structures that separate solute from water (i.e., dilute the tubule fluid) must function normally. In the", "or pressure is corrected. It should be apparent that the AVP and thirst systems work in concert to maintain water balance. An increase in plasma osmolality evokes drinking and, via AVP action on the kidneys, conservation of water. Conversely, when plasma osmolality is decreased, thirst is suppressed and, in the absence of AVP, renal water excretion is enhanced. However, most of the time fluid intake is dictated by cultural factors and social situations. This is especially the case when thirst is not stimulated. In this situation, maintaining normal body fluid osmolality relies solely on the ability of the kidneys to excrete water. How the kidney accomplishes this is discussed in detail in the following sections of this chapter. Renal Mechanisms for Dilution and Concentration of Urine As already", "its segments: (1) the 1. Regulation of body fluid osmolality (i.e., steady-state balance) requires that the amount of water added to the body exactly matches the amount lost from the body. Water is lost from the body by several routes (e.g., during respiration, with sweating, and in feces). The kidneys are the only regulated route of water excretion. Excretion of water by the kidneys is regulated by AVP secreted from the posterior pituitary. When AVP levels are high, the kidneys excrete a small volume of hyperosmotic urine. When AVP levels are low, a large volume of hypoosmotic urine is excreted. 2. Disorders of water balance alter body fluid osmolality. Because Na+ with its anions are the major determinant filtered amount of Na+ is decreased, (2) reabsorption in the", "[Na+] is found in an individual, it is tempting to suspect a problem in Na+ balance. However, the problem most often relates to water balance, not Na+ balance. As described later, changes in Na+ balance result in alterations in the volume of ECF, not its osmolality. The following sections discuss the mechanisms by which the kidneys excrete either hypoosmotic (dilute) or hyperosmotic (concentrated) urine. Control of arginine vasopressin secretion and its important role in regulating excretion of water by the kidneys are also explained (see also \u2022 Fig. 35.1 Relationships between plasma AVP levels, and urine osmolality, urine flow rate, and total solute excretion.

Urine volume under this condition can be as low as 0.5 L/day. In comparing the two conditions just described, it should be apparent that a relatively constant volume of dilute tubular fluid is delivered to the AVP-sensitive portions of the nephron (latter portion of the distal tubule and collecting duct). Plasma AVP levels then determine the amount of water reabsorbed by these segments. When AVP levels are low, a relatively small volume of water is reabsorbed by these segments and a large volume of hypoosmotic urine is excreted (up to 10% of the filtered water). When AVP levels are high, a large volume of water is reabsorbed by these same segments and a small", "the kidneys will continue to conserve water, even though by doing so they reduce the osmolality of the body fluids. With an increase in blood volume or pressure, the opposite occurs. The set point is shifted to higher osmolality values and the slope is decreased. AVP Actions on the Kidneys The primary action of AVP on the kidneys is to enhance absorption of water from the tubular fluid by increasing \u2022 Fig. 35.4 Osmotic and hemodynamic (nonosmotic) control of AVP secretion.

Of this, ~144 L (80%) is reabsorbed isosmotically in the proximal tubule and another 8 L (4\u20135%) is reabsorbed without solute in the descending limb of Henle\u2019s loop. The remainder is diluted to an osmolarity of ~60 mmol/kg by selective reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the ascending limb. In the absence of AVP, the urine issuing from the loop passes largely unmodified through the distal tubules and collecting ducts, resulting in a maximum water diuresis. In the presence of AVP, solute-free water is reabsorbed osmotically through the principal cells of the collecting ducts, resulting in the excretion of a much smaller volume of concentrated urine.

Even within a species, size can vary greatly; a Great Dane, for instance, can weigh over 40 times more than a Chihuahua (Figure 21\u201357). Three variables define the size of an organ or organism: the number of cells, the size of the cells, and the quantity of extracellular material per cell. Size differences can arise from changes in any of these factors (Figure 21\u201358). If we compare a mouse with a human, for example, we find that the difference lies chiefly in the number of cells, there being roughly 3000 times more cells in a human, corresponding to a body that is roughly 3000 times more massive.

As a result, the differences between species are usually more striking to our human eye than the similarities. But at the level of the underlying molecular mechanisms and the macromolecules that mediate them, the reverse is true: the similarities among all animals are profound and extensive. Through more than half a billion years of evolutionary divergence, all animals have retained unmistakably similar sets of genes and proteins that are responsible for generating their body plans and for forming their specialized cells and organs. This astonishing degree of evolutionary conservation was discovered not by broad surveys of animal diversity, but through intensive study of a small number of representative", "to compare in the two species, this might seem an impossible task. But the job was made much easier by confining the search to 35,000 clearly defined multispecies conserved sequences (a total of about 5 million nucleotide pairs), representing parts of the genome that are most likely to be functionally important. Though these sequences are conserved strongly, they are not conserved perfectly, and when the version in one species is compared with that in another they are generally found to have drifted apart by a small amount corresponding simply to the time elapsed since the last common ancestor. In a small proportion of cases, however, one sees signs of a sudden evolutionary spurt.

One very important approach to deciphering our genome is to search for DNA sequences that are closely similar between different species, on the principle that DNA sequences that have a function are much more likely to be conserved than those without a function. For example, humans and mice are thought to have diverged from a common mammalian ancestor about 80 \u00d7 106 years ago, which is long enough for the majority of nucleotides in their genomes to have been changed by random mutational events.

Genetic information is also fundamental to life, and free energy is required for the propagation of this information. For example, to specify one bit of information\u2014that is, one yes/no choice between two equally probable alternatives\u2014 costs a defined amount of free energy that can be calculated. The quantitative relationship involves some deep reasoning and depends on a precise definition of the term \u201cfree energy,\u201d as explained in Chapter 2. The basic idea, however, is not difficult to understand intuitively. Picture the molecules in a cell as a swarm of objects endowed with thermal energy, moving around violently at random, buffeted by collisions with one another. To specify genetic information\u2014in the form of a DNA sequence, for example\u2014molecules from this wild crowd", "in nature. Moreover, calculations based on population genetics reveal that just a tiny selective advantage\u2014less than a 0.1% difference in survival\u2014can be enough to strongly favor retaining a particular DNA sequence over evolutionary time spans. One should therefore not be surprised to find that many DNA sequences that are ultraconserved can be deleted from the mouse genome without any noticeable effect on that mouse in a laboratory. A second important approach for discovering the function of a mysterious noncoding DNA sequence uses biochemical techniques to identify proteins or RNA molecules that bind to it\u2014and/or to any RNA molecules that it produces. Most of this task still lies before us, but a start has been made (see p. 435). Given genome sequence information, we can tackle another intriguing question:", "similar in the two genomes are those in which mutations would have impaired function and put the animals carrying them at a disadvantage, resulting in their elimination from the population by natural selection. Such closely similar pieces of DNA sequence are known as conserved regions. In addition to revealing those DNA sequences that encode functionally important exons and RNA molecules, these conserved regions will include regulatory DNA sequences as well as DNA sequences with functions that are not yet known. In contrast, most nonconserved regions will reflect DNA whose sequence is much less likely to be critical for function. The power of this method can be increased by including in such comparisons the genomes of large numbers of species whose genomes have been sequenced, such as rat, chicken,", "perturbation). Second, this resulting network redundancy provides a survival advantage to the system. In complex gene networks, for example, mutations or polymorphisms in weakly linked genes account for biodiversity and biologic variability without disrupting the critical functions of the system; only mutations in highly linked (essential) genes (hubs) can shut down the system and cause embryonic lethality. Third, scale-free biologic systems facilitate the flow of information (e.g., metabolite flux) across the system compared with randomly organized biologic systems; this so-called \u201csmall-world\u201d property of the system (in which the clustered nature of the highly linked hubs defines a local neighborhood within the network that communicates through weaker, less frequent links to other clusters) minimizes the energy cost for the dynamic action of the system (e.g., minimizes the transition time", "of constant population size and random mating, as well as selective neutrality for the mutations. While neither of the first two assumptions is a good description of human population history, study of this idealized case reveals the general principles in a clear and simple way. When a new neutral mutation occurs in a population of constant size N that is undergoing random mating, the probability that it will ultimately become fixed is approximately 1/(2N). This is because there are 2N copies of the gene in the diploid population, and each of them has an equal chance of becoming the predominant version in the long run. For those mutations that do become fixed, the mathematics shows that the average time to fixation is approximately 4N generations.

Alcohol is absorbed from mucous membranes of the mouth and esophagus (in small amounts), from the stomach and large bowel (in modest amounts), and from the proximal portion of the small intestine (the major site). The rate of absorption is increased by rapid gastric emptying (as seen with carbonation); by the absence of proteins, fats, or carbohydrates (which interfere with absorption); and by dilution to a modest percentage of ethanol (maximum at ~20% by volume). Between 2% (at low blood alcohol concentrations) and 10% (at high blood alcohol concentrations) of ethanol is excreted directly through the lungs, urine, or sweat, but most is metabolized to acetaldehyde, primarily in the liver.

During chronic alcohol consumption, MEOS activity is induced. As a result, chronic alcohol consumption results in significant increases not only in ethanol metabolism but also in the clearance of other drugs eliminated by the cytochrome P450s that constitute the MEOS system, and in the generation of the toxic byproducts of cytochrome P450 reactions (toxins, free radicals, H2O2).

This redundancy implies either that there is more than one tRNA for many of the amino acids or that some tRNA molecules can base-pair with more than one codon. In fact, both situations occur. Some amino acids have more than one tRNA and some tRNAs are constructed so that they require accurate base-pairing only at the first two positions of the codon and can tolerate a mismatch (or wobble) at the third position (Figure 6\u201351). This wobble base-pairing explains why so many of the alternative codons for an amino acid differ only in their third nucleotide (see Figure 6\u201348).

The precise transfer of information from mRNA to protein is governed by genetic code, the set of rules by which codons are translated into an amino acid (Table 15-2).

Because 64 codes are more than enough for 20 amino acids, most amino acids are coded by more than one codon.

CHAPTER SUMMARY Enzymes are protein catalysts that increase the velocity of a chemical reaction by lowering the energy of the transition state (Fig. 5.23). They are not consumed during the reaction. Enzyme molecules contain a special cleft called the active site, which contains amino acid side chains that participate in substrate binding and catalysis. The active site binds the substrate, forming an enzyme\u2013substrate (ES) complex. Binding is thought to cause a conformational change in the enzyme (induced fit) that allows catalysis. ES is converted to enzyme and product. An enzyme allows a reaction to proceed rapidly under conditions prevailing in the cell by providing an alternate reaction pathway with a lower activation energy (Ea). Because the", "70). It does, however, accelerate the rate by which equilibrium is reached. B. Active site chemistry The active site is not a passive receptacle for binding the substrate but, rather, is a complex molecular machine employing a diversity of chemical mechanisms to facilitate the conversion of substrate to product. A number of factors are responsible for the catalytic efficiency of enzymes, including the following examples. 1. Transition-state stabilization: The active site often acts as a flexible molecular template that binds the substrate and initiates its conversion to the transition state, a structure in which the bonds are not like those in the substrate or the product (see T* at the top of the curve in Fig. 5.4). By stabilizing the transition state, the enzyme greatly increases the concentration", "break covalent bonds in a controlled way. It is the catalysis of organized sets of chemical reactions by enzymes that creates and maintains the cell, making life possible. We can group enzymes into functional classes that perform similar chemical reactions (Table 3\u20131). Each type of enzyme within such a class is highly specific, Figure 3\u201345 Small changes in the number of weak bonds can have drastic effects on a binding interaction. This example illustrates the dramatic effect of the presence or absence of a few weak noncovalent bonds in a biological context. Consider 1000 molecules of A and 1000 molecules of B in a eukaryotic cell. The concentration of both will be about 10\u20139 M. If the equilibrium constant (K ) for A + B AB is 1010,", "An identical curve applies to any simple binding interaction between two molecules, A and B. In contrast, a multisubunit allosteric enzyme can respond in a switchlike manner to a change in ligand concentration: the steep response is caused by a cooperative binding of the ligand molecules, as explained in Figure 3\u201360. Here, the green line represents the idealized result expected for the cooperative binding of two inhibitory ligand molecules to an allosteric enzyme with two subunits, and the blue line shows the idealized response of an enzyme with four subunits. As indicated by the two dots on each of these curves, the more complex enzymes drop from 90% to 10% activity over a much narrower range of inhibitor concentration than does the enzyme composed of a single subunit.", "second, and so on.) A random collision between the active site of an enzyme and the matching surface of its substrate molecule often leads immediately to the formation of an enzyme\u2013substrate complex. A reaction in which a covalent bond is broken or formed can now occur extremely rapidly. When one appreciates how quickly molecules move and react, the observed rates of enzymatic catalysis do not seem so amazing. Two molecules that are held together by noncovalent bonds can also dissociate. The multiple weak noncovalent bonds that they form with each other will persist until random thermal motion causes the two molecules to separate. In general, the stronger the binding of the enzyme and substrate, the slower their rate of dissociation. In contrast, whenever two colliding molecules have poorly", "to enzyme and product. An enzyme allows a reaction to proceed rapidly under conditions prevailing in the cell by providing an alternate reaction pathway with a lower activation energy (Ea). Because the enzyme does not change the free energies of the reactants or products, it does not change the equilibrium of the reaction. Most enzymes show Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and a plot of the initial reaction velocity (vo) against substrate concentration ([S]) has a hyperbolic shape similar to the oxygen-dissociation curve of myoglobin. A Lineweaver-Burk plot of 1/v and 1/[S] allows determination of Vmax (maximal velocity) and Km (Michaelis constant, which reflects affinity for substrate). Any substance that can decrease the velocity of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction is called an inhibitor. The two most common types of reversible inhibition are", "on each of these curves, the more complex enzymes drop from 90% to 10% activity over a much narrower range of inhibitor concentration than does the enzyme composed of a single subunit. protein\u2019s activity. When a second enzyme removes the phosphate group, the protein returns to its original conformation and restores its initial activity. Second, an attached phosphate group can form part of a structure that the binding sites of other proteins recognize. As previously discussed, the SH2 domain binds to a short peptide sequence containing a phosphorylated tyrosine side chain (see Figure 3\u201340B). More than ten other common domains provide binding sites for attaching their protein to phosphorylated peptides in other protein molecules, each recognizing a phosphorylated amino acid side chain in a different protein context. Third,", "a cooperative \u201call-or-none\u201d transition are the same for all proteins, whether or not they are enzymes. Thus, for example, they are critical for the efficient uptake and release of O2 by hemoglobin in our blood. But they are perhaps easiest to visualize for an enzyme that forms a symmetric dimer. In the example shown in Figure 3\u201360, the first molecule of an inhibitory ligand binds with great difficulty since its binding disrupts an energetically favorable interaction between the two identical monomers in the dimer. A second molecule of inhibitory ligand now binds more easily, however, because its binding restores the energetically favorable monomer\u2013monomer contacts of a symmetric dimer (this also completely inactivates the enzyme).

Greater activity in central sensory neurons may be perceived as a stronger stimulus. Stimuli of different intensities may also activate different sets of sensory receptors.

For example, the force of a mechanical stimulus to the skin can be encoded in the firing rate of the", "action potential differs from the subthreshold and passive responses in three important ways: (1) It is a response of much larger amplitude, in which the polarity of the membrane potential actually overshoots 0 mV (the cell interior becomes positive in relation to the exterior). (2) The action potential is generally propagated down the entire length of the axon without decrement (i.e., it maintains its size and shape because it is regenerated as it travels along the axon). (3) It is an all-or-none response, which means that a stimulus normally either produces a full-sized action potential or fails to produce one. This all-or-none nature is in contrast both to the graded nature of the passive and local responses described previously and to synaptic responses (see Ionic Basis of Action", "(axons can fire action potentials at rates well over 100 Hz); in this situation, successive EPSPs will be less than 10 msec apart and therefore overlap and sum. Note the higher amplitude of the second peak. Spatial summation refers to the fact that synaptic potentials generated by different synapses can interact. For example, in Fig. 6.8 , suppose axon 1 and 3 each fire an action potential but at widely separated times. Each produces an EPSP that depolarizes the cell but is too small to reach threshold (see Fig. 6.8C , EPSP1, EPSP3). Instead, if both axons fire within a short enough time of each other, their effect can be additive, as shown in Fig. 6.8C (EPSP 1+3). The combined EPSP amplitude may then reach threshold and lead", "axon 1 (distal) or 2 (proximal) both produce EPSPs that are too small to trigger a spike. Thus, generally the summed EPSPs from multiple synapses are required to reach threshold and trigger a spike. The requirement for multiple EPSPs to summate in order to trigger a spike is what makes the relatively long duration of EPSPs so important. Temporal summation refers to the fact that EPSPs that are separated by a latency less than their duration can sum. This is illustrated in Fig. 6.8B , where the same synapse is activated multiple times in rapid succession (axons can fire action potentials at rates well over 100 Hz); in this situation, successive EPSPs will be less than 10 msec apart and therefore overlap and sum. Note the higher amplitude", "an increase in cation permeability. As additional excitatory synapses are activated, there is a graded summation of the EPSPs to increase the size of the depolarization (Figure 21\u20133A, spatial summation, middle). When a sufficient number of excitatory synapses are activated, the excitatory post-synaptic potential depolarizes the postsynaptic cell to threshold, and an all-or-none action potential is generated. Alternatively, if there is a repetitive firing of an excitatory input, the temporal summation of the EPSPs may also reach the action potential threshold (Figure 21\u20133A, right). When an inhibitory pathway is stimulated, the postsynaptic membrane is hyperpolarized owing to the selective opening of chloride channels, producing an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) (Figure 21\u20133B, middle). However, because the equilibrium potential for chloride (see Chapter 14) is only slightly more negative than", "axons fire within a short enough time of each other, their effect can be additive, as shown in Fig. 6.8C (EPSP 1+3). The combined EPSP amplitude may then reach threshold and lead to spiking of the cell. If the EPSPs generated by axons 1 and 3 were simultaneous, then we would have an example of pure spatial summation. In the example shown, however, the times of the two EPSPs were slightly separated, thus we have both spatial and temporal summation present. The fact that EPSPs have a long time course (when compared with action potentials or the underlying EPSCs) facilitates both types of synaptic integration. In the foregoing example, the combined EPSP was approximately the linear summation of the two individual EPSPs evoked by action potentials in axons", "potential rapidly from rest in response to an appropriate stimulus. Two such classes of responses are action potentials and synaptic potentials, which are described in this chapter and the next, respectively. Current knowledge about the ionic mechanisms of action potentials comes from experiments with many species. One of the most studied is the squid because the large diameter (up to 0.5 mm) of the squid giant axon makes it an excellent model for electrophysiological research with intracellular electrodes. The Passive Response To understand how an action potential is generated and why it is needed, it is necessary to understand the passive electrical properties of the nerve cell membrane. The term passive properties refers to the fact that components of the cell membrane behave very similarly to some of", "by which a neuron decides to fire an action potential as a result of its inputs is referred to as synaptic integration. The summation of EPSPs and IPSPs can be highly nonlinear and depends on many factors, including the geometry of the dendritic tree, location of the synaptic inputs relative to the initial segment, and the passive (RC) and active membrane properties of the cell. 12. The efficacy of synaptic transmission depends on the timing and frequency of action potentials in the presynaptic neuron. Facilitation, posttetanic potentiation, and long-term potentiation are examples of increased efficacy of synaptic transmission in response to previous multiple stimulations of a synapse. Long-term depression is an example of reduced efficacy resulting from previous activation of the synapse. 13.

However, the sequence preference of nucleosomes must be weak enough to allow other factors to dominate, inasmuch as nucleosomes can occupy any one of a number of positions relative to the DNA sequence in most chromosomal regions. In addition to its histone fold, each of the core histones has an N-terminal amino acid \u201ctail,\u201d which extends out from the DNA\u2013histone core (see Figure 4\u201324D). These histone tails are subject to several different types of covalent modifications that in turn control critical aspects of chromatin structure and function, as we shall discuss shortly. As a reflection of their fundamental role in DNA function through controlling chromatin structure, the histones are among the most", "inserted into chromatin in a highly selective manner (see Figure 4\u201327). Covalent modifications and Histone variants Act in Concert to Control Chromosome Functions The number of possible distinct markings on an individual nucleosome is in principle enormous, and this potential for diversity is still greater when we allow for nucleosomes that contain histone variants. However, the histone modifications are known to occur in coordinated sets. More than 15 such sets can be identified in mammalian cells. However, it is not yet clear how many different types of chromatin are functionally important in cells. Some combinations are known to have a specific meaning for the cell in the sense that they determine how and when the DNA packaged in the nucleosomes is to be accessed or manipulated\u2014a fact that", "conservation, eukaryotic organisms also produce smaller amounts of specialized variant core histones that differ in amino acid sequence from the main ones. As discussed later, these variants, combined with the surprisingly large number of covalent modifications that can be added to the histones in nucleosomes, give rise to a variety of chromatin structures in cells. Nucleosomes Have a Dynamic Structure, and Are Frequently Subjected to Changes Catalyzed by ATP-Dependent Chromatin Remodeling Complexes For many years biologists thought that, once formed in a particular position on DNA, a nucleosome would remain fixed in place because of the very tight association between its core histones and DNA. If true, this would pose problems for genetic readout mechanisms, which in principle require easy access to many specific DNA sequences. It would", "cell for the next S phase. Chromosome duplication Requires duplication of Chromatin structure The DNA of the chromosomes is extensively packaged in a variety of protein components, including histones and various regulatory proteins involved in the control of gene expression (discussed in Chapter 4). Thus, duplication of a chromosome is not simply a matter of replicating the DNA at its core but also requires the duplication of these chromatin proteins and their proper assembly on the DNA. The production of chromatin proteins increases during S phase to provide the raw materials needed to package the newly synthesized DNA. Most importantly, S-Cdks stimulate a large increase in the synthesis of the four histone subunits that form the histone octamers at the core of each nucleosome. These subunits are assembled", "is also influenced by the accessibility of DNA to the transcriptional apparatus, the amount of DNA, and the arrangement of DNA. [Note: Localized transitions between the B and Z forms of DNA (see p. 414) can also affect gene expression.] 1. Access to DNA: In eukaryotes, DNA is found complexed with histone and nonhistone proteins to form chromatin (see p. 425). Transcriptionally active, decondensed chromatin (euchromatin) differs from the more condensed, inactive form (heterochromatin) in a number of ways. Active chromatin contains histone proteins that have been covalently modified at their amino terminal ends by reversible methylation, acetylation, or phosphorylation (see p. 438 for a discussion of histone acetylation/deacetylation by histone acetyltransferase and histone deacetylase). Such modifications decrease the positive charge of these basic proteins, thereby decreasing the", "genome other than a specific DNA sequence has the central role in attracting ORC and specifying mammalian origins of replication. These ideas could also help to explain how a given mammalian cell chooses which of the many possible origins to use when it replicates its genome and how this choice could differ from cell to cell. Clearly, we have a great deal to discover about the fundamental process of DNA replication initiation. New Nucleosomes Are Assembled Behind the Replication Fork Several additional aspects of DNA replication are specific to eukaryotes. As discussed in Chapter 4, eukaryotic chromosomes are composed of roughly equal mixtures of DNA and protein. Chromosome duplication therefore requires not only the replication of DNA, but also the synthesis and assembly of new chromosomal proteins onto", "H3.3. We shall return to these phenomena in the final section of Chapter 22, where we discuss stem cells and the ways in which one cell type can be converted into another. Although a great deal remains to be learned about the functions of different chromatin structures, the packaging of DNA into nucleosomes was probably crucial for the evolution of eukaryotes like ourselves. To form a complex multicellular organism, the cells in different lineages must specialize by changing the accessibility and activity of many hundreds of genes.

Studies in both vertebrates and invertebrates show that such programs are rarely governed by the timing of cell division and can unfold even when cell division is blocked.

One mechanism depends on coupling hormone synthesis to the size of the thyroid gland, which reflects the size of the tadpole. Only when the gland attains a certain size does it produce enough thyroid hormone to initiate metamorphosis. However, environmental cues other than nutrition also play a part: conditions such as temperature and light are sensed by the nervous system, which regulates the secretion of another tier of hormones (neurohormones) that stimulate the secretion of thyroid hormone.

It also suggests the possibility that other, perhaps subcortical, systems may be needed to generate a trigger signal for the initiation of movement.

Such modifications can be the result of sensory input to the spinal cord, as shown in Fig. 9.10 , in which stimulation of FRA fibers in a peripheral nerve caused a phase shift in the locomotor pattern. They can also be the result of descending commands along the motor pathways discussed earlier. In this case, sensory data (e.g., visual) can be used by the brain to make anticipatory modifications in CPG activity so that potential obstacles can be avoided.

If the FRA fibers were not involved in the locomotion circuit, or at least were not a critical part of the circuits responsible for generating the rhythm (see Fig. 9.10B ), the stimulus would be expected to produce only a transient response (i.e., a single burst in the flexor EMG record and brief inhibition of activity in the extensor EMG record) but to have no long-term effect on ongoing EMG pattern. Such a transient response is observed (see Fig. 9.10A ; EMG records just after the stimulus).

Activity of Motor Cortex Cells The role of individual motor cortex neurons in the control of movement has been extensively investigated in trained monkeys. In these experiments, discharges from a neuron in the primary motor cortex are recorded during the execution of a previously learned simple movement, such as wrist flexion, made immediately in response to a sensory cue (Fig. 9.17 ). Motor cortex neurons were found to change their firing rates before initiation of the movement, and the onset of this change was correlated with the reaction time (i.e., the time from the cue to onset of the movement).

The dashed vertical lines indicate the times at which a flexor EMG response would be expected if the stimulus had produced no phase shift from the EMG activity pattern. Before the stimulus, each vertical line is aligned with the onset of a flexor EMG burst, whereas after the stimulus, each vertical line occurs at the end of the flexor burst. Therefore, the stimulus affected the locomotor CPG itself and the FRA interneurons are a critical part of this CPG (see Fig. 9.10C A second important point illustrated by this experiment is that the locomotion CPG (and CPGs in general) can be influenced by strong afferent fiber", "of the movement, and the onset of this change was correlated with the reaction time (i.e., the time from the cue to onset of the movement). Moreover, in this task, the change in firing of motor cortex neurons was often correlated with the contractile force of the muscle that generates the movement and with the rate of change in force rather than with the position of the joint. These findings suggest that these cells are involved in the final stages of planning and executing movements, which is consistent with the hierarchical view of the cortical motor areas. However, even in these early experiments, the firing rates of some motor cortex cells appeared to relate to earlier planning stages.

During periods of excess photosynthetic capacity during the day, chloroplasts convert some of the sugars that they make into fats and into starch, a polymer of glucose analogous to the glycogen of animals. The fats in plants are triacyl-glycerols (triglycerides), just like the fats in animals, and differ only in the types of fatty acids that predominate. Fat and starch are both stored inside the chloroplast until needed for energy-yielding oxidation during periods of darkness (see Figure 2\u201351C).

Flowering involves a transformation of the behavior of the cells at the growing apex of the plant shoot\u2014the apical meristem.

In flowering, the meristem cells switch to making the components of a flower, with its sepals and petals, its stamens carrying pollen, and its ovary containing the female gametes.

In many organisms, the haploid cells differentiate into specialized reproductive cells called gametes\u2014eggs and sperm in most species. In these species, the reproductive cycle ends when a sperm and egg fuse to form a diploid zygote, which has the potential to form a new individual.

For example, a typical human oocyte contains about 100,000 copies of maternal mitochondrial DNA, whereas a sperm cell contains only a few. In addition, an active process ensures that the sperm mitochondria do not compete with those in the egg. As sperm mature, the DNA is degraded in their mitochondria. Sperm mitochondria are also specifically recognized then eliminated from the fertilized egg cell by autophagy in very much the same way that damaged mitochondria are removed (by ubiquitylation followed by delivery to lysosomes, as discussed in Chapter 13). Because of these two processes, the mitochondrial inheritance in both animals and plants is uniparental.

After the first meiotic division, which results in two daughter cells (2n), the two chromatids of each chromosome separate during a second meiotic division to yield four gametes with a haploid state (1n). When the egg is fertilized by sperm, the two haploid sets are combined, thereby restoring the diploid state (2n) in the zygote. REGULATION OF GENE EXPRESSION Regulation by Transcription Factors The expression of genes is regulated by DNA-binding proteins that activate or repress transcription. The number of DNA sequences and transcription factors that regulate transcription is much greater than originally anticipated. Most genes contain at least 15\u201320 discrete regulatory elements within 300 bp of the transcription start site.

Here, homologous recombination occurs as an integral part of the process whereby chromosomes are parceled out to germ cells (sperm and eggs in animals). We discuss the process of meiosis in detail in Chapter 17; in the following sections, we discuss how homologous recombination during meiosis produces chromosome crossing-over and gene conversion, resulting in hybrid chromosomes that contain genetic information from both the maternal and paternal homologs (Figure 5\u201353). Crossing-over and gene conversion are both generated by homologous recombination mechanisms that, at their core, resemble those used to repair double-strand breaks. Meiotic Recombination Begins with a Programmed Double-Strand Break Homologous recombination in meiosis starts with a bold stroke: a specialized protein (called", "is inherited from the mother. Underlying this law is the accurate parceling out of chromosomes to the germ cells (eggs and sperm) that takes place during meiosis. Thus, when a diploid cell in a parent undergoes meiosis to produce four haploid germ cells, exactly half of the genes distributed among these four cells should be maternal (genes inherited from the mother of this parent) and the other half paternal (genes inherited from the father of this parent). In some organisms (fungi, for example), it is possible to recover and analyze all four of the haploid gametes produced from a single cell by meiosis. Studies in such organisms have revealed rare cases in which the parceling out of genes violates the standard genetic rules. Occasionally, for example, meiosis yields", "by delivery to lysosomes, as discussed in Chapter 13). Because of these two processes, the mitochondrial inheritance in both animals and plants is uniparental. More precisely, the mitochondrial DNA passes from one generation to the next by maternal inheritance. In about two-thirds of higher plants, the chloroplast precursors from the male parent (contained in pollen grains) fail to enter the zygote, so that chloroplast as well as mitochondrial DNA is maternally inherited. In other plants, the chloroplast precursors from the pollen grains enter the zygote, making chloroplast inheritance biparental. In such plants, defective chloroplasts are a cause of variegation: a mixture of normal and defective chloroplasts in a zygote may sort out by mitotic segregation during plant growth and development, thereby producing alternating green and white patches in", "the central question: how are the cells in different positions driven toward their different fates? We have already explained how maternal factors deposited in the developing frog egg define its animal-vegetal axis, and how cortical rotation triggered by fertilization defines the orientation of the dorsoventral axis (see Figure 21\u201314). But how does the establishment of axes lead on to the subdivision of the embryo into the future body parts? The maternal gene products lead to the formation of signaling centers on the vegetal and dorsal sides of the embryo. The dorsal signaling center in particular has a special place in the history of developmental biology. Experiments in the early twentieth century identified it as a small cluster of cells, located on the dorsal side of the amphibian embryo,", "means that it can give rise to every normal type of specialized cell, including even egg or sperm cells for production of the next generation. A cell in such a state is said to be totipotent, and it is said to be pluripotent if it can give rise to most cell types but not absolutely all. Nevertheless, such a progenitor is not a stem cell: it is not self-renewing, but is instead dedicated to a program of progressive differentiation. If it were the only available starting point for study and exploitation of pluripotent cells, the enterprise would require a continual supply of fresh fertilized eggs or fresh nuclear transplantation procedures\u2014an awkward requirement for studies in experimental animals, and unacceptable for practical applications in humans.

This redirects the auxin flux mainly to the lower part of the displaced root, where it inhibits the elongation of the epidermal cells. The resulting asymmetrical distribution of auxin in the Arabidopsis root tip shown here is assessed indirectly, using an auxin-responsive reporter gene that encodes a protein fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP); the epidermal cells on the downward side of the root are green, whereas", "forces so that water leaves cells and reduces intracellular volume.

In fact, it was a study of humans with a strong genetic predisposition for atherosclerosis that first revealed the mechanism of receptor-mediated endocytosis. Most cholesterol is transported in the blood as cholesteryl esters in the form of lipid\u2013protein particles known as low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) (Figure 13\u201351).

Because ligands are selectively captured by receptors, receptor-mediated endocytosis provides a selective concentrating mechanism that increases the efficiency of internalization of particular ligands more than a hundredfold. In this way, even minor components of the extracellular fluid can be efficiently taken up in large amounts. A particularly well-understood and physiologically important example is the process that mammalian cells use to import cholesterol.

However, most cells are unable to synthesize cholesterol and therefore must obtain it from the blood. Normally, cholesterol is ingested in the diet, and it is transported through the blood in association with lipoproteins. Low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) in the blood carry cholesterol to cells, where they bind to LDL receptors in the plasma membrane. After the receptors bind LDL, they collect into \u201ccoated pits\u201d and undergo endocytosis as clathrin-coated vesicles.

Although LDL binds to the surface of these mutant cells, it is not internalized, directly demonstrating the importance of clathrin-coated pits for the receptor-mediated endocytosis of cholesterol. More than 25 distinct receptors are known to participate in receptor-mediated endocytosis of different types of molecules. They all apparently use clathrin-dependent internalization routes and are guided into clathrin-coated pits by signals in their cytoplasmic tails that bind to adaptor proteins in the clathrin coat. Many of these receptors, like the LDL receptor, enter coated pits irrespective of whether they have bound their specific ligands. Others enter preferentially when bound to a specific ligand, suggesting that a ligand-induced conformational change is required for them", "receptors: In addition to the highly specific and regulated receptor-mediated pathway for LDL uptake described above, macrophages possess high levels of scavenger receptor activity. These receptors, known as scavenger receptor class A (SR-A), can bind a broad range of ligands and mediate the endocytosis of chemically modified LDL in which the lipid or apo B component has been oxidized. Unlike the LDL receptor, the scavenger receptor is not downregulated in response to increased intracellular cholesterol.

Some other endocytosed ligands, however, remain bound to their receptors, and thereby share the fate of the receptors. In the early endosome, the LDL receptor dissociates from its ligand, LDL, and is recycled back to the plasma membrane for reuse, leaving the discharged LDL to be carried to lysosomes (Figure 13\u201352). The recycling transport vesicles bud from long, narrow tubules that extend from the early endosomes. It is likely that the geometry of these tubules helps the sorting process: because tubules have a large membrane area enclosing a small volume, membrane proteins become enriched over soluble proteins.

The LDL receptor pathway metabolizes two-thirds of the resultant LDL particles, and the rest is metabolized by a receptor for oxidized LDL (scavenger receptor), to be described later. The LDL receptor binds to apolipoproteins B-100 and E and thus is involved in the transport of both LDL and IDL. Although the LDL receptors are widely distributed, approximately 75% are located on hepatocytes, so the liver plays an extremely important role in LDL metabolism.

The loop of Henle, in particular the thick ascending limb, is the major site where solute and water are separated.

In contrast to these segments, which can only reabsorb K+ , the distal tubule and collecting duct are able to reabsorb or secrete K+ . The rate of K+ reabsorption or secretion by the distal tubule and collecting duct depends on a variety of hormones and factors.

Also, the replication and distribution of mitochondrial DNA during cell division do not follow the nuclear mitotic cycle. Instead, there are contributions during cell division from the genes of various mitochondria to the progeny of dividing cells.

Conversely, the rare mutations that confer a major reproductive advantage on individuals who inherit them can spread rapidly in the population.

Natural selection is most powerful for those traits that influence reproduction in early life, and therefore, the ability of evolution to shape our biology declines with age. Germline mutations that are deleterious in later life can accumulate simply because natural selection cannot act to prevent them. Antagonistic pleiotropy. George C. Williams extended Medawar\u2019s theory when he proposed that evolution can allow for the selection of genes that are pleiotropic, i.e., beneficial for survival and reproduction in early life, but harmful in old age.

All of these theories assume that natural selection has negligible or negative influences on aging. Some postmodern ideas propose that aspects of aging might be adaptive and raise the possibility that evolution can act on the aging process in a positive way. These include the following: Grandmother hypothesis. The grandmother hypothesis proposed by Hamilton in 1966 describes how evolution can enhance old age. In some animals, including humans, the survival of multiple, dependent offspring is beyond the capacity and resources of a single parent. In this situation, the presence of a long-lived grandmother who shares in the care of her grandchildren can have a major impact on their survival. These children share some of the genes of their", "life but contribute to the risk of cancer in old age. Life history theory. Evolution is influenced by the way that limited resources are allocated to all aspects of life including development, sexual maturation, reproduction, number of offspring, and senescence and death. Therefore, \u201ctrade-offs\u201d occur between these phases of life. For example, in a hostile environment, survival is highest for those species that have large numbers of offspring and short lifespan, whereas in a safe and abundant environment, survival is highest for those species that invest resources in a smaller number of offspring and a longer life.

Some parts of the genome will change more easily than others in the course of evolution. A segment of DNA that does not code for protein and has no significant regulatory role is free to change at a rate limited only by the frequency of random errors. In contrast, a gene that codes for a highly optimized essential protein or RNA molecule cannot alter so easily: when mistakes occur, the faulty cells are almost always eliminated. Genes of this latter sort are therefore highly conserved.

While neither of the first two assumptions is a good description of human population history, study of this idealized case reveals the general principles in a clear and simple way. When a new neutral mutation occurs in a population of constant size N that is undergoing random mating, the probability that it will ultimately become fixed is approximately 1/(2N). This is because there are 2N copies of the gene in the diploid population, and each of them has an equal chance of becoming the predominant version in the long run. For those mutations that do become fixed, the mathematics shows that the average time to fixation is approximately 4N generations. Detailed analyses of", "some genes, and more closely to another set of relatives with respect to others. By comparing the DNA sequences of individual human genomes, an intelligent visitor from outer space could deduce that humans reproduce sexually, even if it knew nothing about human behavior. Sexual reproduction is widespread (although not universal), especially among eukaryotes. Even bacteria indulge from time to time in controlled sexual exchanges of DNA with other members of their own species. Natural selection has clearly favored organisms that can reproduce sexually, although evolutionary theorists dispute precisely what that selective advantage is.

Once", "we saw earlier, they account for most of the DNA sequence differences between apes and humans. The spread of neutral mutations is not as rapid as the spread of the rare strongly advantageous mutations. It depends on a random variation in the number of mutation-bearing progeny produced by each mutation-bearing individual, causing changes in the relative frequency of the mutant allele in the population. Through a sort of \u201crandom walk\u201d process, the mutant allele may eventually become extinct, or it may become commonplace.

The vacuole is important as a homeostatic device, enabling plant cells to withstand wide variations in their environment.

Moreover, the plant contains many cells\u2014such as those in the roots\u2014 that lack chloroplasts and therefore cannot produce their own sugars. Thus, sugars are exported from chloroplasts to the mitochondria present in all cells of the plant. Most of the ATP needed for general plant cell metabolism is synthesized in these mitochondria, using exactly the same pathways for the oxidative breakdown of sugars as in nonphotosynthetic organisms; this ATP is then passed to the rest of the cell (see Figure 14\u201342).

Although all cells function as biochemical factories of a broadly similar type, many of the details of their small-molecule transactions differ.

The regenerated ADP is then available to be used for another round of the phosphorylation reaction that forms ATP. The energetically favorable reaction of ATP hydrolysis is coupled to many otherwise unfavorable reactions through which other molecules are synthesized. Many of these coupled reactions involve the transfer of the terminal phosphate in ATP to another molecule, as illustrated by the phosphorylation reaction in Figure 2\u201334. As the most abundant activated carrier in cells, ATP is the principle energy currency.

During periods of excess photosynthetic capacity during the day, chloroplasts convert some of the sugars that they make into fats and into starch, a polymer of glucose analogous to the glycogen of animals. The fats in plants are triacyl-glycerols (triglycerides), just like the fats in animals, and differ only in the types of fatty acids that predominate. Fat and starch are both stored inside the chloroplast until needed for energy-yielding oxidation during periods of darkness (see Figure 2\u201351C). The embryos inside plant seeds must live on stored sources of energy for a prolonged period, until they germinate and produce leaves that can harvest the energy in sunlight.

The energy-conversion systems of mitochondria and chloroplasts can be described in similar terms, and we shall see later in the chapter that two of their key components are closely related.

In this latter case, ATP hydrolysis serves to maintain the proton gradient across the plasma membrane, which is used to power many other essential cell functions including nutrient transport and the rotation of bacterial flagella.
