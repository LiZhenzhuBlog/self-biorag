Lower urinary tract disorders include disorders of storage (such as urinary incontinence), emptying (such as urinary hesitancy and retention), and sensation (such as urgency or pain). Current definitions for these disorders are depicted in Table 26.1.

The sensory nerve fibers vary greatly in size and in the thickness of their myelin covering; based on these dimensions, they are classified as type A, B, or C, as discussed in Chap. 7. The ventral, or anterior (efferent, or motor), roots are composed of the emerging axons of anterior and lateral horn cells and motor nuclei of the brainstem. Large, heavily myelinated fibers terminate on muscle fibers and smaller unmyelinated ones terminate in sympathetic or parasympathetic ganglia. From these autonomic ganglia issue the axons that terminate in smooth muscle, heart muscle and conducting system, and glands. Traversing the subarachnoid space, where they lack well-formed epineurial sheaths, the cranial and spinal roots (both sensory and motor)", "has primarily a motor function. Correspondingly, it is the main target of descending motor pathways from the brain. In contrast, the dorsal horn is the major recipient of incoming sensory information and the main source of ascending sensory pathways (e.g., the spinothalamic tract; see Chapter 7). The description of the motor function of the spinal cord therefore begins with the properties of motor neurons and their organization in the ventral horn. Similar organizational principles hold for cranial nerve nuclei that are involved in controlling the musculature of the head and face (e.g., the facial and motor trigeminal nuclei). A motor neuron is a neuron that projects to muscle cells. Because motor neurons represent the only route for CNS activity to control muscle activity, motor neurons have been termed", "been described, from simple, free terminals to highly branched and encapsulated structures, the latter bearing the names of the anatomists who first described them (see below). In some texts these nerve endings are called \u201cdendrites\u201d because they are the distal processes of the sensory ganglion cell and the direction of flow of physiologic activity and of sensory information from these structures in the periphery is toward the cell body. Mechanisms of Cutaneous Sensation As indicated in the preceding chapter, it had been thought that each of the primary modalities of cutaneous sensation is subserved by a morphologically distinct end organ, each with its separate peripheral nerve fibers. These can be broadly categorized as cutaneous and subcutaneous mechanoreceptors, muscle and joint mechanoreceptors, thermal receptors, and pain receptors (nociceptors). According", "and tightly attached. The skin of the glans is so thin that blood within its large, muscular anastomosing veins that drain the corpus spongiosum may give it a bluish color. There is no adipose tissue in the subcutaneous tissue. There is, however, a thin layer of smooth muscle that is continuous with the dartos layer of the scrotum. In uncircumcised males, the glans is covered with a fold of skin, the prepuce, which resembles a mucous membrane on its inner aspect. Numerous sebaceous glands are present in the skin of the penis just proximal to the glans. The penis is innervated by somatic, sympathetic, and parasympathetic nerves. Many sensory nerve endings are distributed throughout the tissue of the penis, and sympathetic and parasympathetic visceral motor fibers innervate the", "target organ. In organs containing smooth muscle that is innervated by parasympathetic fibers and therefore not under voluntary control, there is a parallel innervation of adjacent voluntary striated muscle by anterior horn cells. For example, the neurons that activate the external sphincter of the bladder (voluntary muscle) differ from those that supply the smooth muscle of the internal sphincter as discussed further on.

Some interlobular arteries terminate near the periphery of the cortex, whereas others enter the kidney capsule to provide its arterial supply. Afferent arterioles give rise to the capillaries that form the glomerulus. The glomerular capillaries reunite to form an efferent arteriole that, in turn, gives rise to a second network of capillaries, the peritubular capillaries. The arrangement of these capillaries differs according to whether they originate from cortical or juxtamedullary glomeruli. \u0081 Efferent arterioles from cortical glomeruli lead into a peritubular capillary network that surrounds the local uriniferous tubules (G1 and G2, Fig. 20.24). \u0081 Efferent arterioles from juxtamedullary glomeruli descend", "the efferent arteriole, which leads into a second capillary network, the peritubular capillaries, which supply blood to the nephron.

Ultrastructure of the Nephron The functional unit of the kidneys is the nephron. Each human kidney contains approximately 1.2 million nephrons, which are essentially hollow tubes composed of a single epithelial cell layer. The nephron consists of a renal corpuscle, proximal tubule, loop of Henle, distal tubule, and collecting duct system (Fig. 33.3 Fig. 33.2 ).

The glomerular capillaries are supplied by an afferent arteriole and are drained by an efferent arteriole that then branches, forming a new capillary network to supply the kidney tubules. The site where the afferent and efferent arterioles penetrate and exit from the parietal layer of Bowman\u2019s capsule is called the vascular pole. Opposite this site is the urinary pole of the renal corpuscle, where the proximal convoluted tubule begins (see Fig. 20.7). Continuing from Bowman\u2019s capsule, the remaining parts of the nephron (the tubular parts) are as follows: \u0081 Proximal thick segment, consisting of the proximal con voluted tubule (pars convoluta) and the proximal straight tubule (pars recta)\u0081 Thin segment, which constitutes the thin part of the loop", "The collecting tubules, responsible for the final concentration of the urine, are analogous to the ducts of exocrine glands.

The supplementary motor area is the most anterior portion of area 6 on the medial surface of the cerebral hemisphere (area 6b in Fig. 3-3B).

Stimulation of Brodmann area 4 produces movement of discrete muscle groups or, if sufficiently refined, of individual muscles. Repertoires of larger coordinated movements are evoked by stimulation of area 6, the premotor and supplementary motor cortices.

Motor impulses from the frontal lobe are conducted by the direct corticospinal tract and by tracts that descend from the motor, premotor, supplementary motor, and anterior parietal cortex to the spinal cord, either directly or via the red and reticular nuclei in the brainstem.

The muscle groups of the contralateral face, arm, trunk, and leg are represented in the primary motor cortex (area 4 in Fig. 3-3), those of the face being in the most inferior part of the precentral gyrus on the lateral surface of the cerebral hemisphere and those of the leg in the paracentral lobule on the medial surface of the cerebral hemisphere.

He also noted the inconstancy of stimulatory effects; the stimulation of a given cortical point that initiated flexion of a part on one occasion might initiate extension on another.

This pattern of activity causes one or more joints in the stimulated limb to flex. In addition, commissural interneurons evoke the opposite pattern of activity in the contralateral side of the spinal cord (see Fig. 9.9 ), which results in extension of the opposite limb, the crossed extension reflex. For lower limbs in humans (or for both forelimbs and hind limbs in quadrupeds), the crossed extension part of the reflex helps in maintaining balance by enabling the contralateral limb to be able to support the additional load that is transferred to it when the flexed limb is lifted.

These motor areas are located within the cingulate sulcus at approximately the same anterior-posterior level as the SMA. There are three cingulate motor areas (dorsal, ventral, and rostral; see Fig. 9.14B ). Each contains a somatotopic map and contributes to the corticospinal tract.

Discrete voluntary movements of the hand are executed more slowly than normal, and attempts to perform them may result in a co-contraction of antagonistic muscles and a spread (overflow) of contraction to muscles not normally required in the movement. The overflow appears related to a failure of the striatum to suppress the activity of unwanted muscle groups.

In lesions of the third, fourth, or sixth cranial nerves, a neural origin is disclosed by the pattern of ocular muscle palsies, abnormalities of the pupil, or both. When weakness of the orbicularis oculi (muscles of eye closure) is added to weakness of eye opening (levator palpebrae; ptosis), it nearly always signifies myasthenia gravis. The rare primary disease of ocular", "of the visual pathway caudal to the point where the light reflex fibers leave the optic tract will not alter the pupillary light reflex (Fig. 13-9). The \u201crelative afferent pupillary defect,\u201d or Marcus Gunn pupillary sign, exposes a retrobulbar optic neuropathy. It is best identified by the \u201cswinging-flashlight test,\u201d in which each pupil is alternately exposed to light at 1-s intervals; the pupils both show a poor constriction or even paradoxical dilatation when light is shined on the side of an optic neuropathy. It is best to assess in a dimly lighted room with the patient fixating on a distant target. Hippus, a rapid fluctuation in pupillary size, is common in metabolic encephalopathy but otherwise has no particular significance and is occasionally seen in normal persons. To distinguish", "eye abducts and the other fails to adduct, one can conclude that the medial longitudinal fasciculus has been interrupted (an internuclear ophthalmoplegia on the side of adductor paralysis) or that the third nerve nucleus has been damaged. Abducens palsy is indicated by an esotropic resting position and a lack of outward deviation of one eye with the reflex maneuvers. The complete absence of ocular movement in response to oculovestibular testing indicates a severe disruption of brainstem tegmental systems in the pons and midbrain or, as already mentioned, a profound overdose of sedative, anesthetic, or anticonvulsant drugs. A reduction in the frequency and eventual loss of spontaneous blinking, then a loss of response to touching the eyelashes, and, finally, a lack of response to corneal touch (the corneal reflex", "afferent pupillary defect (Marcus Gunn pupil) can be elicited with the swinging flashlight test (Fig. 39-2). It is an extremely useful sign in retrobulbar optic neuritis and other optic nerve diseases, in which it may be the sole objective evidence for disease. In bilateral optic neuropathy, no afferent pupil defect is present if the optic nerves are affected equally. Subtle inequality in pupil size, up to 0.5 mm, is a fairly common finding in normal persons. The diagnosis of essential or physiologic anisocoria is secure as long as the relative pupil asymmetry remains constant as ambient lighting varies. Anisocoria that increases in dim light indicates a sympathetic paresis of the iris dilator muscle. The triad of miosis with ipsilateral ptosis and anhidrosis constitutes Horner\u2019s syndrome, although anhidrosis is", "of a recurrent unilateral headaches associated with weakness of extraocular muscles. A transient third-nerve palsy with ptosis, with or without involvement of the pupil, is the usual picture; rarely, the sixth nerve is affected. This disorder almost exclusively occurs in children. As a general rule, the diagnosis should not be made in adults unless there had been recurrent bouts in childhood. The ocular paresis often outlasts the headache by days or weeks; after many attacks, a slight mydriasis and some degree of ophthalmoparesis may remain permanently. We and others have encountered instances of gadolinium enhancement of the proximal, cisternal portion of the third nerve during and after an attack. However, in adults the syndrome of headache, unilateral ophthalmoparesis, and loss of vision may have more serious causes, including", "diplopia are the initial neural symptoms; their association with ptosis, strabismus, and extraocular muscle palsies, particularly of the sixth nerve, may at first suggest a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. In botulism, however, accommodation is lost and the pupils are often unreactive to light. Other symptoms of bulbar involvement\u2014nasality of voice, hoarseness, dysarthria, dysphagia, and an inability to phonate\u2014follow in quick succession. These, in turn, are followed by progressive weakness of the muscles of the face, neck, trunk, and limbs, and by respiratory insufficiency. Despite the oropharyngeal weakness, it is not unusual for the gag reflex to be retained. Tendon reflexes are lost in cases of severe generalized weakness.

Both groups of muscles are innervated by the facial nerve [VII]. Sensory innervation of the auricle is from many sources (Fig. 8.115): The outer more superficial surfaces of the auricle are supplied by the great auricular nerve (anterior and posterior inferior portions) and the lesser occipital nerve (posterosuperior portion) from the cervical plexus and the auriculotemporal branch of the mandibular nerve [V3] (anterosuperior portion).

Unlike the medial pterygoid muscle whose fibers tend to be oriented vertically, those of the lateral pterygoid are oriented almost horizontally. As a result, when the lateral pterygoid contracts it pulls the articular disc and head of the mandible forward onto the articular tubercle and is therefore the major protruder of the lower jaw. The lateral pterygoid is innervated by the nerve to the lateral pterygoid from the mandibular nerve [V3]. When the lateral and medial pterygoids contract on only one side, the chin moves to the opposite side. When opposite movements at the two temporomandibular joints are coordinated, a chewing movement results. The mandibular nerve [V3] is the largest of the three divisions of the trigeminal nerve [V].

This activity, called foveation, or looking, is governed by an elaborate efferent motor sys-tem. Each eye is moved by six extraocular muscles that are supplied by cranial nerves from the oculomotor (III), trochlear (IV), and abducens (VI) nuclei.

The other important muscles of inspiration are the external intercostal muscles, which pull the ribs upward and forward during inspiration (see Fig. 20.10 ).

Normal breathing is actively inspiratory and only passively expiratory; however, under some circumstances of increased respiratory drive, the internal intercostal muscles and abdominal muscles actively expel air. The expiratory neurons that mediate this activity are concentrated in the caudal portions of the ventral respiratory group and in the most rostral parts of the dorsal group. On the basis of both neuroanatomic tracer and physiologic studies, it has been determined that these expiratory neurons project to spinal motor neurons and have an inhibitory influence on inspiratory neurons.

They can also move the ribs. The eleven pairs of external intercostal muscles extend from the inferior margins (lateral edges of costal grooves) of the ribs above to the superior margins of the ribs below.

The most superficial of the three flat muscles in the anterolateral group of abdominal wall muscles is the external oblique, which is immediately deep to the superficial fascia (Fig. 4.27, Table 4.1).

Under normal circumstances, the lung and the passive chest wall enclose essentially the same volume, the only difference being the volumes of the pleural fluid and of the lung parenchyma (both quite small). For this reason and because the lung and chest wall function in mechanical series, the pressure required to displace the passive respiratory system (lungs plus chest wall) at any volume is simply the sum of the elastic recoil pressure", "anterior abdominal wall above from the thigh of the lower limb below. The iliac crest separates the posterolateral abdominal wall from the gluteal region of the lower limb.

A retropleural approach is generally used as this technique prevents widespread contamination of the thorax if a postoperative anastomotic leak occurs. The sequence of steps is as follows: (a) mobilization of the pleura to expose the struc-tures in the posterior mediastinum; (b) division of the fistula and closure of the tracheal opening; (c) mobilization of the upper esophagus sufficiently to permit an anastomosis without tension and to determine whether a fistula is present between the upper esophagus and the trachea (forward pressure", "confirmation of the diagnosis.

A thorough examination of the fundus of the stomach (by retroflexing the endoscope) is imperative as well. The extent of tumor spread to the mediastinum and para-aortic lymph nodes should be assessed by computed tomography (CT) scans of the chest and abdomen and by endoscopic ultrasound.

The electrical impulse that triggers a normal cardiac contraction originates at regular intervals in the sinoatrial (SA) node (Figure 14\u20131), usually at a frequency of 60\u2013100 bpm. This impulse spreads rapidly through the atria and enters the atrioventricular (AV) node, which is normally the only conduction pathway between the atria and ventricles. Conduction through the AV node is slow, requiring about 0.15 seconds. (This delay provides time for atrial contraction to propel blood into the ventricles.) The impulse then propagates down the His-Purkinje system and invades all parts of the ventricles, beginning with the endocardial surface near the apex and ending with the epicardial surface at the base of the heart. Activation of the entire ventricular myocardium is complete FIGURE 14\u20131 Schematic representation", "the extreme, the result can be complete heart block, where no impulses are conducted from the atria to the ventricles. In this situation, ventricular activity is generated by a latent pacemaker, such as a Purkinje cell. Because the AV node is typically under the tonic influence of the parasympathetic nervous system, which slows conduction, AV block can sometimes be relieved by antimuscarinic agents like atropine. A serious form of conduction abnormality involves reentry (also known as \u201ccircus movement\u201d). In this situation, one impulse reenters and excites areas of the heart more than once. The path of the reentering impulse may be confined to very small areas, such as within or near the AV node or where a Purkinje fiber makes contact with the ventricular wall (Figure 14\u20136), or", "because of the large diameter of the Purkinje fibers, conduction velocity (1 to 4 m/second) in these fibers exceeds that in any other fiber type within the heart. The increased conduction velocity enables rapid activation of the entire endocardial surface of the ventricles. The action potentials recorded from Purkinje fibers resemble those of ordinary ventricular myocardial fibers. However, because of the long refractory period of Purkinje fiber action potentials, many premature excitations of the atria are conducted through the AV junction but are then blocked by the Purkinje fibers. Blockade of these atrial excitations prevents premature contraction of the ventricles. This function of protecting the ventricles against the effects of premature atrial depolarization is especially pronounced at slow heart rates because the action potential duration, and hence the", "contraction of the ventricles. This function of protecting the ventricles against the effects of premature atrial depolarization is especially pronounced at slow heart rates because the action potential duration, and hence the effective refractory period, of the Purkinje fibers vary inversely with the heart rate (see Fig. 16.16 ). At slow heart rates, the effective refractory period of the Purkinje fibers is especially prolonged. In contrast to Purkinje fibers, the effective refractory period of AV node cells does not change appreciably over the normal range of heart rates and actually increases at very rapid heart rates. Therefore, when the atrium is excited at high repetition rates, it is the AV node that normally protects the ventricles from these excessively high frequencies. The first portions of the ventricles to", "subendothelial branches, commonly called Purkinje fibers. The components of the conducting system convey impulses at a rate approximately four times faster than the cardiac muscle fibers and are the only elements that can convey impulses across the fibrous skeleton. If the SA node fails to function (e.g., because of insufficient blood supply), then the area with the next fastest intrinsic rate of depolarization will take over. In this situation, the AV node will drive the heart contractions at a rate of about 50 beats per minute. In complete heart block when the conduction of electric impulses to the ventricles is interrupted, the ventricles will beat at their own rate of about 30 to 40 beats per minute, driven by depolarization of Purkinje fibers. Purkinje fibers have the slowest", "this spontaneous depolarization are discussed in depth in Fig. 16.17 , once an action potential is initiated in the sinoatrial node, it is propagated between atrial cells via gap junctions, as well as through specialized conduction fibers in the atria. The action potential can pass throughout the atria within approximately 70 msec. For the action potential to reach the ventricles, it must pass through the atrioventricular node, after which the action potential passes throughout the ventricle via specialized conduction pathways (the bundle of His and the Purkinje system) and gap junctions in the intercalated disks of adjacent cardiac myocytes. The action potential can pass through the entire heart within 220 msec after initiation in the sinoatrial node. Because contraction of a cardiac muscle cell typically lasts 300 msec,", "(KACh). Acetylcholine also depresses the if and iCa currents. The autonomic neural effects on cardiac cells are described in greater detail in When the SA node or other components of the atrial pacemaker complex are excised or destroyed, pacemaker cells in the AV junction generally take over the pacemaker function for the entire heart. After some time, which may vary from minutes to days, automatic cells in the atria usually become dominant again and resume their pacemaker function. Purkinje fibers in the specialized conduction system of the ventricles also display automaticity. These fibers characteristically fire at a very slow rate. When the AV junction cannot conduct cardiac impulses from the atria to the ventricles, these idioventricular pacemakers in the Purkinje fiber network initiate the ventricular contractions, but at", "and left bundle branches, and the subendocardial plexus of conduction cells (the Purkinje fibers). The unique distribution pattern of the cardiac conduction system establishes an important unidirectional pathway of excitation/contraction. Throughout its course, large branches of the conduction system are insulated from the surrounding myocardium by connective tissue. This tends to decrease inappropriate stimulation and contraction of cardiac muscle fibers. The number of functional contacts between the conduction pathway and cardiac musculature greatly increases in the subendocardial network. Thus, a unidirectional wave of excitation and contraction is established, which moves from the papillary muscles and apex of the ventricles to the arterial outflow tracts. Impulses begin at the sinu-atrial node, the cardiac pacemaker. This collection of cells is located at the superior end of the crista terminalis at", "the impulse throughout the ventricles.

Precursors within the sinus venosus give rise to the SA node, whereas those within the AV canal mature into heterogeneous cell types that compose the AV node. Myocardial cells transdifferentiate into Purkinje fibers to form the distal conduction system. Fast and slow conducting cell types within the nodes and bundles are characterized by expression of distinct gap junction proteins, including connexins, and ion channels that characterize unique cell fates and electrical properties of the tissues.

Atropine can be used to reverse high vagal tone; however, if AH prolongation and AV block at long pacing cycle lengths persists, intrinsic AV node disease is likely. Type II second-degree block is typically infranodal, often in the His-Purkinje system. Block below the node with prolongation of the HV interval or a His bundle electrogram with no ventricular activation (Fig. 275-5) is abnormal unless it is elicited at fast pacing rates or short coupling intervals with extra stimulation. It is often difficult to determine the type of second-degree AV block when 2:1 conduction is present; however, the finding of a His bundle electrogram after every atrial electrogram indicates that block is occurring in the distal conduction system.

In addition, muscles can act as fixators to immobilize a joint and in postural roles. Moreover, the relationship two muscles have to each other may depend on the specific movement being performed.

Ascertaining the extent and severity of muscle weakness requires a systematic examination of the main groups of muscles. The patient is asked to contract each group with as much force as possible, while the examiner opposes the movement and offers a graded resistance in accordance with the degree of residual power (isokinetic contraction). Alternatively, the patient is asked to produce a maximal contraction and the examiner estimates power by the force needed to overcome or \u201cbreak\u201d it (isometric contraction or maximum voluntary isometric contraction).

The soft palate elevates to open the oropharyngeal isthmus while at the same time sealing off the nasal part of the pharynx from the oral part.

With some infections, these structures can become edematous and contribute significantly to airflow resistance. The epiglottis and arytenoid cartilage (attached to the vocal cords) cover or act as a hood over the vocal cords during swallowing. Thus under normal circumstances, the epiglottis and arytenoid cartilage function to prevent aspiration of food and liquid into the lower respiratory tract. The act of swallowing food after mastication (chewing) usually occurs within 2 seconds, and it is closely synchronized with muscle reflexes that coordinate opening and closing of the airway. Hence, air is allowed to enter the lower airways, and food and liquids are kept out.

This partitioning prevents pressure generated in the oropharynx from being dissipated through the nose. When the soft palate is paralyzed, for example, after a cerebrovascular accident, food is commonly regurgitated into the nasopharynx. During swal-lowing, the hyoid bone moves upward and anteriorly, elevating the larynx and opening the retrolaryngeal space, bringing the epiglottis under the tongue (see Fig. 25-12). The backward tilt of the epiglottis covers the opening of the larynx to prevent aspi-ration.

During swallowing, the rima glottidis, rima vestibuli, and vestibule are closed and the laryngeal inlet is narrowed. In addition, the larynx moves up and forward. This action causes the epiglottis to swing downward toward the arytenoid cartilages and to effectively narrow or close the laryngeal inlet (Fig. 8.225E). The up and forward movement of the larynx also opens the esophagus, which is attached to the posterior aspect of the lamina of the cricoid cartilage. All these actions together prevent solids and liquids from entry into the airway and facilitate their movement through the piriform fossae into the esophagus. The major blood supply to the larynx is by the superior and inferior laryngeal arteries (Fig. 8.226): The superior laryngeal artery originates", "muscles, which close the nasopharynx and prevent nasal regurgitation, followed by (2) the upward and forward movement of the arytenoid cartilages toward the epiglottis (observed as an upward displacement of the hyoid and thyroid cartilages), which closes the airway.

The airway is closed by sequential contractions of the arytenoid\u2013epiglottic folds, and below them, the false cords, and then the true vocal cords, which seal the trachea. All of these muscular contractions are effected largely by cranial nerve X (vagus).

In newborns, the larynx is high in the neck and the epiglottis is above the level of the soft palate (Fig. 8.16E). Babies can therefore suckle and breathe at the same time.

Furthermore, cricopharyngeal bars may be secondary to other neuromuscular disorders. Since the pharyngeal phase of swallowing occurs in less than a second, rapid-sequence fluoroscopy is necessary to evaluate for functional abnormalities. Adequate fluoroscopic examination requires that the patient be conscious and cooperative. The study incorporates recordings of swallow sequences during ingestion of food and liquids of varying consistencies. The pharynx is examined to detect bolus retention, regurgitation into the nose, or aspiration into the trachea.

The events described previously represent the early stage of endochondral bone formation that occurs in the fetus, beginning at about the twelfth week of gestation. The continuing growth process that lasts into early adulthood is described in the following section. Growth in length of long bones depends on the presence of epiphyseal cartilage.

The new osteoblasts, in turn, lay down bone matrix in successive layers, giving rise to woven bone. This immature bone, discussed on page 223, is characterized internally by interconnecting spaces occupied by connective tissue and blood vessels. Bone tissue formed by the process just described is referred to as membrane bone or intramembranous bone.

During embryogenesis, long bones develop from a cartilage mold by the process of endochondral ossification. A cartilage mold (anlagen) is synthesized by mesenchymal precursor cells. At approximately 8 weeks\u2019 gestation, the central portion of the anlagen is resorbed, creating the medullary canal. Simultaneously, at midshaft (diaphysis), osteoblasts begin to deposit the cortex beneath the periosteum producing the primary center of ossification and growing the bone radially. At each longitudinal end (epiphysis), endochondral ossification proceeds in a centrifugal fashion (secondary center of ossification). Eventually, a plate of the cartilage becomes entrapped between the two expanding centers of ossification, forming the physis or growth plate ( Fig. 21.3 ). The chondrocytes within the growth plate undergo sequential proliferation, hypertrophy, and apoptosis.

In addition, as a bone grows, some of the bone tissue is removed while newer bone tissue is being laid down, a process called remodeling. Remodeling that alters the shape of the bone is called external remodel-ing; that which does not alter the shape of the bone, as in the formation of Haversian systems, is called internal remodeling. Two specialized cell types are identified with the process", "new bone until, finally, there is no remaining cartilage. At this point, the epiphyseal and diaphyseal marrow cavities become confluent. The elimination of the epiphyseal plate is referred to as epiphyseal closure. In illustration 9 of Figure 8.17, the lower epiphyseal cartilage is no longer present; in illustration 10, both epiphyseal cartilages are gone. Growth is now complete, and the only remaining cartilage is found on the articular surfaces of the bone. Vestigial evidence of the site of the epiphyseal plate is reflected by an epiphyseal line consisting of bone tissue (see Fig. 8.2). Development of the Osteonal (Haversian) System Osteons typically develop in preexisting compact bone. Compact bone can take several different forms. Compact bone may be formed from fetal spongy bone by continued deposition of bone", "unique shape, both external and internal remodeling must occur as the bone grows in length. The proliferative zone of the epiphyseal plate gives rise to the cartilage on which bone is later laid down. In reviewing the growth process, it is important to realize the following: \u0081 The thickness of the epiphyseal plate remains relatively constant during growth. \u0081 The amount of new cartilage produced (zone of prolifera tion) equals the amount resorbed (zone of resorption). \u0081 The resorbed cartilage is, of course, replaced by spongy bone. Actual lengthening of the bone occurs when new cartilage matrix is produced at the epiphyseal plate. Production of new cartilage matrix pushes the epiphysis away from the diaphysis, elongating the bone.

They also include the progressive loss of plasticity (i.e., the ability to become other cell types). For example, the myeloid progenitor can make all cells in the myeloid series but none in the lymphoid series.

Each muscle has an oblique part and a straight part: The oblique part runs in a posterior direction from the arch of the cricoid cartilage to the inferior horn of the thyroid cartilage.

The cricothyroid joints enable the thyroid cartilage to move forward and tilt downward on the cricoid cartilage (Fig. 8.219). Because the vocal ligaments pass between the posterior aspect of the thyroid angle and the arytenoid cartilages that sit on the lamina of cricoid cartilage, forward movement and downward rotation of the thyroid cartilage on the cricoid cartilage effectively lengthens and puts tension on the vocal ligaments. The crico-arytenoid joints between articular facets on the superolateral surfaces of the cricoid cartilage and the bases of the arytenoid cartilages enable the arytenoid cartilages to slide away or toward each other and to rotate so", "caudally to their final positions as development continues. The thyroid gland is a large, unpaired gland, while the parathyroid glands, usually four in number, are small and are on the posterior surface of the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland is anterior in the neck below and lateral to the thyroid cartilage (Fig. 8.178). It consists of two lateral lobes (which cover the anterolateral surfaces of the trachea, the cricoid cartilage, and the lower part of the thyroid cartilage) with an isthmus that connects the lateral lobes and crosses the anterior surfaces of the second and third tracheal cartilages.

The free margin between these two points of attachment is thickened to form the vocal ligament, which is under the vocal fold (true vocal cord) of the larynx.

After passing posteriorly to the root of the lungs, the right and left vagus nerves approach the esophagus. As they reach the esophagus, each nerve divides into several branches that spread over this structure, forming the esophageal plexus (Fig. 3.99). There is some mixing of fibers from the two vagus nerves as the plexus continues inferiorly on the esophagus toward the diaphragm.

The anterior rami of C1 to C4 form the cervical plexus. The major branches from this plexus supply the strap muscles, the diaphragm (phrenic nerve), skin on the anterior and lateral parts of the neck, skin on the upper anterior thoracic wall, and skin on the inferior parts of the head (Fig. 8.15B).

Its musculomembranous walls surround a large cavity (the abdominal cavity), which is bounded superiorly by the diaphragm and inferiorly by the pelvic inlet. The abdominal cavity may extend superiorly as high as the fourth intercostal space, and is continuous inferiorly with the pelvic cavity. It contains the peritoneal cavity and the abdominal viscera.

Blood moves rapidly through the aorta and its arterial branches. As these branches approach the periphery, the branches narrow, and their walls become thinner. They also change histologically.

This arrangement, which is discussed in subsequent chapters, has important implications in terms of resistance, flow, and pressure in blood vessels.

This pressure gradient differential is less than 7% of the pressure gradient differential of 87 mm Hg present in the systemic circulation (90 mm Hg in the aorta minus 3 mm Hg in the right atrium).

The right pulmonary artery enters the root of the lung and gives off a large branch to the superior lobe of the lung. The main vessel continues through the hilum of the lung, gives off a second (recurrent) branch to the superior lobe, and then divides to supply the middle and inferior lobes. The left pulmonary artery is shorter than the right and lies anterior to the descending aorta and posterior to the superior pulmonary vein (Fig. 3.49).

The pulmonary venous system is located at a distance from the respiratory passages at the periphery of the bronchopulmonary segments.

Venous blood from the capillaries of the bronchial circulation flows to the heart through either true bronchial veins or bronchopulmonary veins. True bronchial veins are present in the region of the lung hilus, and blood flows into the azygos, hemiazygos, or intercostal veins before entering the right atrium. The bronchopulmonary veins are formed through a network of tributaries from the bronchial and pulmonary circulatory vessels that anastomose and form vessels with an admixture of blood from both circulatory systems.

There are ten bronchopulmonary segments in each lung (Fig. 3.48); some of them fuse in the left lung.

It is of clinical consequence that the axons carrying pain impulses from each dermatome decussate as they ascend one to three segments rostral to the level of root entry. For this reason, a discrete lesion of the lateral spinal cord creates a loss of pain and thermal sensation of the contralateral trunk, the dermatomal level of which is two to three segments below that of the spinal cord lesion. As the ascending fibers cross the cord, they are added to the inner side of the spinothalamic tract (the principal afferent pathway of the anterolateral fasciculus), so that the longest fibers from the sacral segments come to lie most superficially and fibers from successively more rostral levels occupy progressively deeper positions (Fig. 7-3).

The rate of gastric emptying is dependent on the macronutrient content of the meal and the amount of solids it contains. Thus solids and liquids of similar nutritional composition will empty at different rates. Liquids empty rapidly, but solids do so only after a lag phase,", "failure of the distal esopha-geal sphincter to relax. The loss of esophageal contractions can result in the stasis of food, esophageal dilatation, regurgitation, and aspiration. The presence of these abnormalities signals end-stage motor disease. In these situations, esophageal replace-ment is usually required to establish normal alimentation. Before proceeding with esophageal resection for patients with end-stage benign disease, the choice of the organ to substitute for the esophagus (i.e., stomach, jejunum, or colon) should be considered. The choice of replacement is affected by a num-ber of factors, as described later in \u201cTechniques of Esophageal Reconstruction.\u201d If minimally invasive esophagectomy is to be performed, thoracoscopic dissection should be combined with abdominal dissection. Attempts at MIS transhiatal esophagec-tomy for the massively dilated esophagus may result in large volume bleeding from mediastinal", "much of the grinding and mixing occurs. A linear emptying phase follows, during which the smaller particles are metered out to the duodenum. Solid gastric emptying is a function of meal particle size, caloric con-tent, and composition (especially fat). When liquids and solids are ingested together, the liquids empty first. Solids are stored in the fundus and delivered to the distal stomach at constant rates for grinding. Liquids also are sequestered in the fundus, but they appear to be readily delivered to the distal stomach for early emptying. The larger the solid component of the meal, the slower the liquid emptying. Patients bothered by dumping syn-drome are advised to limit the amount of liquid consumed with the solid meal, taking advantage of this effect.

The problem is formidable: the human brain contains more than 1011 neurons, each of which, on average, has to make connections with a thousand others, according to a regular and predictable wiring plan. The precision required is not so great as in a man-made computer, because the brain performs its computations in a different way and is more tolerant of vagaries in individual components. But the human brain nevertheless outstrips all other biological structures in its organized complexity.

The axoaxonic synapse may enhance or inhibit the axodendritic (or axosomatic) synapse. (Modified from Barr ML. The Human Nervous System. New York: Harper & Row, 1979.) Synapses are classified as chemical or electrical. Classification depends on the mechanism of conduction of the nerve impulses and the way the action potential is gener-ated in the target cells. Thus, synapses may", "of the types we have already discussed. In the next phase, newborn neurons extend axons and dendrites along specific routes toward their target cells, guided by extracellular signals that attract or repel them. In the third phase, neurons form synapses with other neurons or muscle cells, setting up a provisional but orderly network of connections. In the final phase, which continues into adult life, the synaptic connections are adjusted and refined through mechanisms that usually depend on synaptic signaling between the cells involved terminal branches of axon make 25 \u00b5m synapses on target cells Figure 21\u201366 A typical neuron of a vertebrate. the arrows indicate the direction in which signals are conveyed. the neuron shown is a basket cell, a type of neuron in the cerebellum. (adapted from", "similar self-avoidance strategies. Eventually, axonal growth cones reach the target region where they must halt and make synapses. These synapses, as a rule, are destined to transmit neural signals in one direction, from axon to target cell. The development of synapses, however, depends on signaling in both directions: signals from the target tissue not only help control which growth cones synapse where (as we discuss shortly), but can also regulate how many of the innervating neurons survive. Many types of vertebrate neurons are produced in excess; up to 50% or more of some of them die soon after they reach their target, even though they appear perfectly normal and healthy up to the time of their death. About half of all the motor neurons that send axons to", "cortical territory is allocated to axons that carry information and is not wasted on those that are silent. Activity-dependent synaptic changes are not confined to early life. They also occur in the adult brain, where many synapses show both functional and morphological alterations with use. This synaptic plasticity is thought to have a fundamental role in learning and memory. Clearly, for the nervous system as for other parts of the body, developmental processes do not end at birth, as we discuss in the next chapter. The development of the nervous system proceeds in four phases. First, neurons and glial cells are generated from dividing neural progenitor cells. Then, the newborn neurons send out axons and dendrites toward their targets. Next, they make synaptic connections with appropriate target cells", "by which a neuron decides to fire an action potential as a result of its inputs is referred to as synaptic integration. The summation of EPSPs and IPSPs can be highly nonlinear and depends on many factors, including the geometry of the dendritic tree, location of the synaptic inputs relative to the initial segment, and the passive (RC) and active membrane properties of the cell. 12. The efficacy of synaptic transmission depends on the timing and frequency of action potentials in the presynaptic neuron. Facilitation, posttetanic potentiation, and long-term potentiation are examples of increased efficacy of synaptic transmission in response to previous multiple stimulations of a synapse. Long-term depression is an example of reduced efficacy resulting from previous activation of the synapse. 13.

Examples of such complex receptive fields are discussed in Coding of Information by Action Potentials Central to CNS function is the transmission of information between neurons. This is accomplished primarily through action potentials, which propagate down the axon to the presynaptic terminals and cause neurotransmitter release, signaling the postsynaptic cells. As already explained, the regenerative nature of action potentials allows them to carry signals regardless of the length of the axon, whereas local signals, such as receptor or synaptic potentials (see ), decay with distance and are therefore not suitable for this purpose. The tradeoff, however, is that the all-or-none nature of action potentials means that their shape", "are propagated down the axon are initiated (see ).

Neurons are special because of their ability to control and respond to electricity. Moreover, the response and control mechanisms of each part of a neuron are distinct from those in other parts. This intraneuronal specialization is a consequence of the particular morphology and the ion channel composition of each part of the neuron. For example, dendrites have ligand gated ion channels that allow neurons to respond to chemicals released by other neurons, and their characteristic branching pattern allows for integration of multiple input", "project long distances but also emit small collaterals that synapse onto local interneurons. These neurons are excitatory, and their synaptic influences, which involve ionotropic receptors, are very short-lived. The excitatory transmitter released from these cells is, in most instances, glutamate. Local circuit neurons are typically smaller than projection neurons, and their axons arborize in the immediate vicinity of the cell body. Most of these neurons are inhibitory, and they release either GABA or glycine. They synapse primarily on the cell body of the projection neurons but can also synapse on the dendrites of projection neurons as well as with each other.

The medial surface of the ramus of the mandible is the lateral wall of the infratemporal fossa (Fig. 8.137B). Its most distinctive feature is the mandibular foramen, which is the superior opening of the mandibular canal. The inferior alveolar nerve and vessels pass through this foramen.

These buttresses are oriented vertically and horizontally and distribute forces applied to the bones in order to maintain their shape and position with-out fracturing. There are three paired vertical buttresses called the nasomaxillary, zygomaticomaxillary, and pterygomaxillary buttresses. The horizontal buttresses of the midface pass through the superior and inferior orbital rims and hard palate. A guiding principle of facial facture management is to restore the integrity of these buttresses.Mandible FracturesMandibular fractures are common injuries that may lead to permanent disability if not diagnosed and properly treated.

The oculomotor nerve [III] leaves", "muscle diseases are identified by a predominantly proximal weakness that is symmetric. The following patterns of muscle involvement constitute a core of essential clinical knowledge in this field. Subacute and chronic evolution of weakness is distinguished in each category from more acute causes. Ocular palsies presenting as ptosis, diplopia, and strabismus Primary diseases of muscle do not involve the pupil, and in most instances their effects are bilateral. In lesions of the third, fourth, or sixth cranial nerves, a neural origin is disclosed by the pattern of ocular muscle palsies, abnormalities of the pupil, or both. When weakness of the orbicularis oculi (muscles of eye closure) is added to weakness of eye opening (levator palpebrae; ptosis), it nearly always signifies myasthenia gravis. The rare primary disease of ocular", "of a recurrent unilateral headaches associated with weakness of extraocular muscles. A transient third-nerve palsy with ptosis, with or without involvement of the pupil, is the usual picture; rarely, the sixth nerve is affected. This disorder almost exclusively occurs in children. As a general rule, the diagnosis should not be made in adults unless there had been recurrent bouts in childhood. The ocular paresis often outlasts the headache by days or weeks; after many attacks, a slight mydriasis and some degree of ophthalmoparesis may remain permanently. We and others have encountered instances of gadolinium enhancement of the proximal, cisternal portion of the third nerve during and after an attack. However, in adults the syndrome of headache, unilateral ophthalmoparesis, and loss of vision may have more serious causes, including", "a characteristic alternating hyperdeviation depending on the direction of gaze (unilateral traumatic trochlear paresis is still the more common finding with head injury). A useful review of the approach to vertical diplopia is given by Palla and Straumann. Lesions of the sixth nerve result in a paralysis of the abducens muscle and a resultant weakness of lateral or outward movement leading to a crossing of the visual axes. The affected eye deviates medially, that is, in the direction of the opposing muscle. Diplopia is experienced as horizontal separation that is greatest when viewing in the direction of the sixth nerve palsy and in the distance (Fig 13-7A). With incomplete sixth nerve palsies, turning the head toward the side of the paretic muscle overcomes the diplopia. Many causes of", "nerve paresis may appear to have full eye movements despite a complaint of horizontal diplopia upon looking to the left. In this situation, the cover test provides a more sensitive method for demonstrating the ocular misalignment. It should be conducted in primary gaze and then with the head turned and tilted in each direction. In the above example, a cover test with the head turned to the right will maximize the fixation shift evoked by the cover test. Occasionally, a cover test performed in an asymptomatic patient during a routine examination will reveal an ocular deviation. If the eye movements are full and the ocular misalignment is equal in all directions of gaze (concomitant deviation), the diagnosis is strabismus.

Intoxication with organophosphate insecticides, because of their capacity to induce a cholinergic crisis, may be confused with a myasthenic crisis (see further on). Certain other small clinical points may be helpful in differentiating myasthenia from other diseases that affect the cranial musculature. A hanging jaw and hanging head are indicative of myasthenia, whereas complete or asymmetric facial paresis is typical of GBS. Botulism usually affects the pupillary convergence reaction, and GBS does so only when there is complete internal and external ophthalmoplegia; diphtheria affects mainly the accommodative reaction early on. The question of midbrain stroke as a consequence of basilar artery occlusion arises in a case with total ophthalmoplegia; it should be recalled that the level of", "diplopia are the initial neural symptoms; their association with ptosis, strabismus, and extraocular muscle palsies, particularly of the sixth nerve, may at first suggest a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis.

Other symptoms of bulbar involvement\u2014nasality of voice, hoarseness, dysarthria, dysphagia, and an inability to phonate\u2014follow in quick succession. These, in turn, are followed by progressive weakness of the muscles of the face, neck, trunk, and limbs, and by respiratory insufficiency.

In the circulatory system model shown in Fig. 19.12, consider the hemodynamic consequences that would occur if the right ventricle suddenly ceased its pump function but instead served merely as a passive, low-resistance conduit between the systemic veins and the pulmonary arteries. Under these conditions, the only functional pump would be the left ventricle, which would then be required to pump blood through both the systemic and pulmonary resistances (for the purposes of this discussion, consider the resistance to the flow of blood through the inactive right ventricle to be negligible). Normally, pulmonary vascular resistance is approximately 10% as great as systemic vascular resistance. Because the two resistances are in series with one another, total resistance would be 10% greater than systemic resistance alone (see ).

Finally, numerous small openings\u2014the openings of the smallest cardiac veins (the foramina of the venae cordis minimae)\u2014are scattered along the walls of the right atrium. These are small veins that drain the myocardium directly into the right atrium. In the anatomical position, the right ventricle forms most of the anterior surface of the heart and a portion of the diaphragmatic surface. The right atrium is to the right of the right ventricle and the right ventricle is located in front of and to the left of the right atrioventricular orifice. Blood entering the right ventricle from the right atrium therefore moves in a horizontal and forward direction.

This has traditionally required a lateral tunnel within the right atrium to direct blood from the inferior vena cava to the pulmo-nary artery, allowing further relief of the volume load on the RV and providing increased pulmonary blood flow to alleviate cyanosis. More recently, many favor using an extracardiac con-duit (e.g., 18to 20-mm tube graft) to connect the inferior vena cava to the pulmonary artery (Fig. 20-40).Not all patients with HLHS require this three-stage pallia-tive repair.

However, the distribution of blood circulating to the different regions of the body is determined by the output of the left ventricle and by the contractile state of the resistance vessels (arterioles) of these regions. The circulatory system is composed of conduits arranged in series and in parallel ( Fig. 15.1 ). This arrangement, which is discussed in subsequent chapters, has important implications in terms of resistance, flow, and pressure in blood vessels. Blood entering the right ventricle via the right atrium is pumped through the pulmonary arterial system at a mean pressure about one seventh that in the systemic arteries. The blood then passes through the lung capillaries, in which CO2 in the blood is released and O2", "(left-right shunt) or due to myocardial dysfunction (dilated cardiomyopathy). The shape of the heart may suggest specific congenital heart defects. The most common examples are the boot-shaped heart seen with tetralogy of Fallot, the egg-on-a-string seen with dextroposed transposition of the great arteries, and the \u201csnowman\u201d seen with supracardiac total anomalous pulmonary venous return. The chest x-ray can aid in the assessment of pulmonary blood flow. Defects associated with left-to-right shunting have increased pulmonary blood flow (shunt vascularity) on x-ray. Right-to-left shunts have decreased pulmonary blood flow. Echocardiography has become the most important noninvasive tool in the diagnosis and management of cardiac disease,providing a full anatomic evaluation in most congenital heartdefects (Fig. 139-4). Physiologic data on the direction of bloodflow can be obtained with the use of pulsed,", "extracardiac prosthetic conduit to replace the pulmonary artery (Rastelli procedure). This is a family of complex lesions with both atrioventricular valves or a common atrioventricular valve opening to a single ventricular chamber. Associated anomalies include abnormal great artery positional relationships, pulmonic valvular or subvalvular stenosis, and subaortic stenosis. Survival to adulthood depends on a relatively normal pulmonary blood flow, yet normal pulmonary resistance and good ventricular function. Modifications of the Fontan approach are generally applied to carefully selected patients with creation of a pathway(s) from the systemic veins to the pulmonary arteries. This malformation is characterized by atresia of the tricuspid valve; an interatrial communication; and, frequently, hypoplasia of the RV and pulmonary artery.

The nares, mouth, anus, vagina, and urethra are used to access the respiratory, GI, and urinary systems. The advantage of using these points of access is that no incision is required. The disadvantages lie in the long distances between the orifice and the region of interest. For NOTES procedures, the vagina may serve as point of access, entering the abdomen via the posterior cul-de-sac of the pelvis.

The lymphatics from the uterine corpus are distributed to two groups of nodes. One set of vessels drains into the internal iliac nodes.

Proprioceptive information is transmitted by yet another route that partially overlaps with the dorsal column\u2013medial lemniscal pathway.

This double crossing highlights the general rule that each half of the cerebellum is functionally related to the ipsilateral side of the body. To provide proprioceptive information from the lower limb to the cerebral cortex, the main axons of the dorsal spinocerebellar tract give off a branch in the medulla that terminates in nucleus z, which is just rostral to the nucleus gracilis. The axons of cells from nucleus z then form part of the internal arcuate fibers and medial lemniscus and ascend to the VPL nucleus of the thalamus. The ascending somatosensory pathways to the cerebellum for the upper limb are simpler than those from the lower limb (see Fig. 7.1B ). The route to the cerebellum starts with", "of function of the pyramidal tract (so named because the corticospinal tract passes through the medullary pyramid). However, in many cases of pyramidal tract disease, the functions of other pathways are also altered, and most signs of pyramidal tract disease (see the later section \u201c Caused by Lesions of Descending Motor Pathways \u201d) are apparently not caused solely by loss of the corticospinal tract but also reflect damage to additional motor pathways. The CHAPTER 9 Organization of Motor Function term extrapyramidal is even more problematic. Thus this classification system is not used in this book. Another way of classifying the motor pathways is based on their sites of termination in the spinal cord and the consequent differences in their roles in the control of movement and posture. The", "are excitatory on other parts of the motor nervous system. According to the scheme of Jansen and Brodal, cells of the vermis project mainly to the fastigial nucleus; those of the intermediate zone, to the globose and emboliform nuclei (that are combined in humans as the interpositus, or \u201cinterposed\u201d nucleus); and those of the lateral zone, to the dentate nucleus. The deep cerebellar nuclei, in turn, project to certain thalamic and brainstem nuclei via two main pathways: fibers from the dentate and interposed nuclei form the superior cerebellar peduncle, enter the upper pontine tegmentum as the brachium conjunctivum, decussate at the level of the inferior colliculus, and ascend to the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus and, to a lesser extent, to the intralaminar thalamic nuclei (Fig. 5-3). Some", "medial side (Figs. 4-1 and 4-2). By virtue of their close connections with the caudate and lenticular nuclei, the subthalamic nucleus (nucleus of Luys) and the substantia nigra are included as parts of the basal ganglia. The claustrum and amygdaloid nuclear complex, despite their largely different connections and functions, are sometimes included although they do not participate in any direct way in the modulation of movement. For reasons indicated further on, some physiologists have expanded the list of basal ganglionic structures to include the red nucleus, the intralaminar thalamic nuclei, and the reticular formations of the upper brainstem. These structures receive direct cortical projections and give rise to rubrospinal and reticulospinal tracts that run parallel to the corticospinal (pyramidal) ones; hence they also were once referred to as", "at different levels ranging from the subthalamus to the medulla and are connected with each other. The best known is the midbrain locomotor region, which is thought to organize commands to initiate locomotion. It is located in the midbrain at the level of the inferior colliculus. Voluntary activity that originates in the motor cortex can trigger locomotion by the action of corticobulbar fibers projecting to the midbrain locomotor region. The commands are relayed through the reticular formation and then to the spinal cord via the reticulospinal tracts. Motor Control by the Cerebral Cortex Thus far in this chapter, emphasis has been on reflexes and relatively automatic types of movement. We now discuss the neural basis for more complex, goal-directed voluntary movement. Such movement often varies when repeated and", "loops. The non-GABAergic, excitatory nuclear cells project to a variety of targets from the spinal cord to the thalamus. In general, each nucleus gives rise to crossed ascending and descending projections that leave the cerebellum via the superior cerebellar peduncle. The fastigial nucleus also gives rise to significant uncrossed fibers, as well as a second crossed projection called the uncinate gyrus, or hook bundle, that leaves via the inferior cerebellar peduncle. Although there are differences in the specific targets of each nucleus, in general, the ascending cerebellar projections target midbrain structures, such as the red nucleus and superior colliculus, and the ventral lateral nucleus of the thalamus, which connects to the primary motor cortex and thereby links the cerebellum to motor areas of the cerebrum. (The cerebral motor", "structures from generating unwanted motor activity and the \u201cswitch\u201d function referring to the capacity of the basal ganglia to select which of many available motor programs will be active at any given time. Still other theoretical constructs focus on the role of the basal ganglia in the initiation, sequencing, and modulation of motor activity (\u201cmotor programming\u201d). Also, it appears that the basal ganglia participate in the constant priming of the motor system, enabling the rapid execution of motor acts without premeditation\u2014for example, hitting a baseball. In most ways, these conceptualizations restate the same notions of balance and selectivity imparted to all motor actions by the basal ganglia. Physiologic evidence reflects this balanced architecture, one excitatory and the other inhibitory within the individual circuits. The direct striatomedial pallidonigral pathway", "influences motor planning, and it also affects the discharge of corticospinal and corticobulbar neurons. The direct pathway appears to function as follows: Neurons in the striatum have little background activity, but during movement they are activated by their input from the cortex. In contrast, neurons in the GPi have a high level of background activity. When the striatum is activated, its inhibitory projections to the globus pallidus slow the activity of pallidal neurons. However, the pallidal neurons themselves are inhibitory, and they normally provide tonic inhibition of neurons in the VA and VL nuclei of the thalamus. Therefore, activation of the striatum causes disinhibition of neurons of the VA and VL nuclei. When disinhibited, the VA/VL neurons increase their firing rates, exciting their target neurons in the motor", "are complex physiologic relationships among the deep nuclei, and cerebellar cortical regions generally have inhibitory influences on the deep nuclei. The flocculonodular lobe has among the most complex influences, being inhibitory to the fastigial nucleus but also projecting directly in an inhibitory manner to the lateral vestibular (Deiters) nucleus. The vestibular nuclei, and in particular the lateral one, may be considered, in effect the equivalent of a deep cerebellar nucleus.

However, visceral afferent fibers also contain many neuropeptides or combinations of neuropeptides, including angiotensin II, arginine vasopressin, bombesin, calcitonin gene\u2013related peptide, cholecystokinin, galanin, substance P, enkephalin, oxytocin, somatostatin, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide.

In addition, smooth muscle cells may be stimulated or inhibited by hormones secreted by the adrenal medulla (e.g., epinephrine and norepinephrine). Also oxytocin is a potent stimulator of smooth muscle contraction, and its release by the posterior pituitary plays an essential role in uterine contraction during parturition. It is often used to induce or enhance labor.

Oxytocin release also may be triggered by olfactory, auditory, and visual clues, and it may play a role in the conditioned re\ufb02ex in nursing animals.

Feelings of desire may be triggered by both internal (e.g., fantasies, memories, feelings of arousal) and external (e.g., an interested and interesting partner). Sexual cues are dependent on adequate neuroendocrine function. Multiple neurotransmitters, peptides, and hormones modulate desire and subjective arousal (9).

The primary function of this hormone in humans is the stimulation of two specific types of muscular contractions (Fig. 7.8). The first type, uterine muscular contraction, occurs during parturition.

Pain, trauma, emotional stress, and drugs such as nicotine also stimulate release of ADH. Oxytocin promotes contraction of smooth muscle of the uterus and myoepithelial cells of the breast. Oxytocin is a more potent promoter of smooth muscle contraction than is ADH. Its primary effect includes promotion of contraction of \u0081 uterine smooth muscle during orgasm, menstruation, and parturition.

Neurons of lamina III (association efferents) send axons to other parts of the association cortex in the same and opposite hemisphere. Neurons of layer V (projection efferents) send axons to subcortical structures and the spinal cord. Neurons of layer VI project mainly to the thalamus.

As the process continues, more severe constriction of the fields, with greater nasal or inferior nasal loss, is found, often inevident to the patient. These issues are elaborated below.

Diagonal postures, for example, flexion of one arm and extension of the opposite arm and leg, usually indicate a supratentorial lesion. Forceful extensor postures of the arms and weak flexor responses of the legs are usually seen with lesions at about the level of the vestibular nuclei. Lesions below this level lead to flaccidity", "often not possible to distinguish a hemiplegia of pontine origin from one of deep cerebral origin unless there is an associated cranial nerve palsy to triangulate the lesion to a specific part of the brainstem. In both, the face, arm, hand, leg, and foot are affected because of the location of the descending motor fibers into a small segmental region in both structures. With brainstem lesions, as with cerebral ones, a flaccid paralysis gives way to spasticity after a few days or weeks, and there is no satisfactory explanation for the occurrence in some cases of spasticity from the onset of the stroke. There is also may be a combined hemiparesis and ataxia of the limbs on the same side. With a hemiplegia of pontine origin, however, the", "spasticity. A comparable state of areflexia and hypotonia may occur with acute cerebral lesions but is less sharply defined than is the spinal state. With some acute cerebral lesions, spasticity and paralysis develop together; in others, especially with parietal lesions, the limbs remain flaccid but reflexes are retained. Spasticity, Hyperreflexia, and the Babinski Sign The identifying characteristics of paralysis from an upper motor neuron lesion are a predilection for involvement of certain muscle groups, a specific pattern of response of muscles to passive stretch (where resistance increases linearly in relation to velocity of stretch), and a manifest exaggeration of tendon reflexes.

Aphasia, dysarthria, cerebellar ataxia, and walking may improve for a year or longer, but for all practical purposes it may be said that whatever motor and language deficits remain after 5 to 6 months will be permanent. Characteristically, the paralyzed muscles are flaccid in the first days or weeks following a stroke; the tendon reflexes are usually unchanged but may be slightly increased or decreased. Gradually spasticity develops, and the tendon reflexes become brisker. The arm tends to assume a flexed adducted posture and the leg an extended one. Function is rarely if ever restored after the slow evolution of spasticity; however, the use of botulinum toxin may help", "which reason we have on occasion asked a neurosurgeon to remove a midlumbar (L2 or L3) motor rootlet for examination. Also particularly difficult diagnostically is a polyradiculopathy that involves the motor roots exclusively or predominantly and is indistinguishable from motor neuron disease except for the absence of widespread denervation or of progressive upper motor neuron signs and differing from the immune motor neuropathies discussed further on by the absence of conduction block. In these common syndromes, reduced sensation, weakness, muscular atrophy, and loss of tendon reflexes progress over a period of months or years. Within this large category, two groups are distinguished. In the first and less chronic of the two, the neuropathy appears over months or a year or two. Comprising this group are acquired processes such", "diphtheria, tick paralysis, and basilar artery occlusion. Bilateral but asymmetrical facial and abducens weakness coupled with distal paresthesias or with proximal leg weakness is one of several other variants in our experience (Ropper, 1994). The tendon reflexes may be absent only at the ankles or at the knees. Lyme disease and sarcoidosis are then considerations in diagnosis. Whether bifacial palsy alone represents a variant of GBS is uncertain, but almost every case in our experience has had an alternative explanation. Paraparetic, ataxic, and purely motor or purely sensory forms of the illness have also been observed. Less difficulty attends the correct diagnosis of GBS if paresthesias in the acral extremities, progressive reduction or loss of reflexes, and relative symmetry of weakness appear after several days.

In cases of total leg and thigh weakness, one first considers a spinal cord disease. Motor neuron disease may begin in the legs, asymmetrically and distally as a rule, and affect them disproportionately to other parts of the body. Thus the differential diagnosis of distal or generalized leg weakness involves more diseases than are involved in the restricted paralyses of other parts of the body.

Adrenal medullary cells, which are embryologically analogous to post-ganglionic sympathetic neurons, release a mixture of epinephrine and norepinephrine. Finally, most autonomic nerves also release several cotransmitter substances (described in the following text), in addition to the primary transmitters just described. Five key features of neurotransmitter function provide potential targets for pharmacologic therapy: synthesis, storage, release, termination of action of the transmitter, and receptor effects.

Other genital lesions, such as urethral diverticula or embryonic cysts, may cause similar symptoms. Differential Diagnosis The causes of postmenopausal bleeding and the percentage of patients who seek treatment for different conditions are presented in Table 14.16. Hormone therapy may be used to manage troublesome menopausal symptoms; it is recommended to treat with the lowest effective dose with the risks versus benefits regularly reviewed by a woman and her doctor (246). Women who are taking hormone therapy during menopause may be using a variety of hormonal regimens that can result in bleeding (see Chapter 34).

A prescription should be given in advance of need when no over-the-counter access is available. Emergency contraception reduces the risk of pregnancy after unprotected intercourse if used within 5 days, although efficacy is greatest when used as early as possible. Other indications and contraindications to emergency postcoital contraception are listed in Table 69-7. There are two forms of emergency contraception: (a) Plan B (0.75 mg of levonorgestrel), one pill taken twice, 12 hours apart, or two tablets given once and (b) using a CHC pill the equivalent of 50 mg of ethinyl estradiol and 250 \u03bcg of norgestrel, each repeated in 12 hours. Plan B is also associated with significantly less nausea and vomiting than the CHC regimen.

Disadvantages are mainly related to maintaining the programmable pump and injection site and lack of availability of an appropriate pump in the United States. After ovulation, luteal phase support is necessary and may be provided with hCG, progesterone, or continuation of the GnRH therapy. For women with overt POI (also known as premature ovarian failure, as noted above), there is no good evidence to suggest that any treatment can increase the chance of conception with autologous oocytes (85). Treatments that were tried include ovulation induction with clomiphene or gonadotropin, pretreatment with high-dose estrogen or gonadotropinreleasing hormone agonist followed by expectant management or gonadotropin stimulation, standard-dose hormone therapy followed by gonadotropin, and corticosteroid pretreatment followed by gonadotropin.

The intervening layer, the arachnoid, is adjacent but not attached to the dura mater. The arachnoid sends numerous, weblike arachnoid trabeculae to the pia mater.

Deep to the arachnoid mater is the only normally occurring fluid-filled space associated with the meninges, the subarachnoid space (Fig. 8.35). It occurs because the arachnoid mater clings to the inner surface of the dura mater and does not follow the contour of the brain, while the pia mater, being against the surface of the brain, closely follows the grooves and fissures on the surface of the brain. The narrow subarachnoid space is therefore created between these two membranes (Fig. 8.35).

These venous (dural) sinuses receive blood from the principal cerebral veins and carry it to the internal jugular veins. Sheetlike extensions of the inner surface of the dura mater form partitions between parts of the brain, supporting those parts within the cranial cavity and carrying the arachnoid to some of the deeper parts of the brain. In the spinal canal, the vertebrae have their own periosteum, and the dura mater forms a separate tube surrounding the spinal cord (see", "between the arachnoid and pia mater contains CSF (Fig. 2.59).

These fractures are often part of complex facial fractures. Fractures within the orbit frequently occur within the floor and the medial wall; however, superior and lateral wall fractures also occur. Inferior orbital floor fractures are one of the commonest types of injuries. These fractures may drag the inferior oblique muscle and associated tissues into the fracture line. In these instances, patients may have upward gaze failure (upward gaze diplopia) in the affected eye. Medial wall fractures characteristically show air within the orbit in radiographs.

Each sinus drains through the medial floor into its frontonasal duct, which empties into the middle meatus within the nose.Treatment of a frontal sinus fracture depends on the frac-ture characteristics as shown in the algorithm (Fig. 45-54).

The pathophysiology of orbital blow-out fractures is (a) hydraulic from increased intraocular pressure or (b) buckling from direct bone conduction. This requires surgical intervention if there is a defect of >2 cm2 or >50% of the floor with herniation.61 A forced duction test, where the muscular attachment of the inferior oblique is grasped with forceps and manipulated to determine passive ocular mobility, is performed to ensure that there is not inferior rectus entrapment.

Sometimes, the anterior maxillary bone that has been fractured and is accessed in the process of repairing other factures can also be used.62There are three classic patterns of more extensive mid-face fractures: Le Fort I, II, and III. However, fractures rarely follow this exact pattern, and the two sides of the face may have different Le Fort fractures. Nonetheless, a full under-standing of midface buttresses is central in understanding these fractures (Fig. 18-18).

Thus, it is important to resuspend those specific areas. It is difficult to achieve optimal results when the paravaginal repair is used in combination with traditional central repairs because of the creation of tension on opposing suture lines. A repair that removes a weakened central vaginal wall may decrease the side-to-side dimensions of the anterior vaginal wall, making it difficult to suspend its lateral points more laterally. When large central defects coexist with lateral defects, one option is an extensive central repair accompanied by an apical support procedure.

The slow growth of most tumors permits accommodation of the brain to changes in cerebral blood flow and ICP.

This action causes the epiglottis to swing downward toward the arytenoid cartilages and to effectively narrow or close the laryngeal inlet (Fig. 8.225E). The up and forward movement of the larynx also opens the esophagus, which is attached to the posterior aspect of the lamina of the cricoid cartilage.

Similarly, the pericardiacophrenic vessels are also located within and supply the fibrous pericardium as they pass through the thoracic cavity. The parietal layer of serous pericardium", "also from the third and fifth, cervical spinal cord segments. The phrenic nerves descend through the thorax to supply motor and sensory innervation to the diaphragm and its associated membranes. As they pass through the thorax, they provide innervation through somatic afferent fibers to the mediastinal pleura, fibrous pericardium, and parietal layer of serous pericardium. The right phrenic nerve enters the superior mediastinum lateral to the right vagus nerve and lateral and slightly posterior to the beginning of the right brachiocephalic vein (see Fig. 3.94). It continues inferiorly along the right side of this vein and the right side of the superior vena cava. On entering the middle mediastinum, the right phrenic nerve descends along the right side of the pericardial sac, within the fibrous pericardium, anterior to", "heads and necks of ribs (intercostal nodes), and with the diaphragm (diaphragmatic nodes) (Fig. 3.31). Diaphragmatic nodes are posterior to the xiphoid and at sites where the phrenic nerves penetrate the diaphragm. They also occur in regions where the diaphragm is attached to the vertebral column. Parasternal nodes drain into bronchomediastinal trunks. Intercostal nodes in the upper thorax also drain into bronchomediastinal trunks, whereas intercostal nodes in the lower thorax drain into the thoracic duct. Nodes associated with the diaphragm interconnect with parasternal, prevertebral, and juxta-esophageal nodes, brachiocephalic nodes (anterior to the brachiocephalic veins in the superior mediastinum), and lateral aortic/lumbar nodes (in the abdomen). Superficial regions of the thoracic wall drain mainly into axillary lymph nodes in the axilla or parasternal nodes. Innervation of the thoracic wall", "interstitial lung disease. Unilateral paralysis of the diaphragm may result from compression of the phrenic nerve in the thorax by tumor or aortic aneurysm; an idiopathic or postinfectious variety may be related to brachial plexitis (see Chap. 43). The diaphragm and accessory muscles may be severely affected in some types of muscular dystrophies, but usually in association with pelvocrural and shoulder muscle weakness. Nocturnal dyspnea, sleep apnea, and respiratory arrest may occur, particularly in myasthenics and in patients with glycogen storage myopathies, and respiratory failure may threaten life in severe myasthenia gravis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and poliomyelitis. As a general observation, in the acute neuromuscular paralyses, the cervical and shoulder muscles and the diaphragm, all of which share a common innervation, show a similar degree of weakness. Asking the", "is covered by the mediastinal part of the parietal pleura. Posterior to the esophagus, the thoracic duct is on the right side inferiorly, but crosses to the left more superiorly. Also on the left side of the esophagus is the thoracic aorta. Anterior to the esophagus, below the level of the tracheal bifurcation, are the right pulmonary artery and the left main bronchus. The esophagus then passes immediately posteriorly to the left atrium, separated from it only by pericardium. Inferior to the left atrium, the esophagus is related to the diaphragm. Structures other than the thoracic duct posterior to the esophagus include portions of the hemiazygos veins, the right posterior intercostal vessels, and, near the diaphragm, the thoracic aorta. The esophagus is a flexible, muscular tube that can", "and the parietal pleura lining the wall of the thoracic cavity. The lung does not completely fill the potential space of the pleural cavity, resulting in recesses, which do not contain lung and are important for accommodating changes in lung volume during breathing. The costodiaphragmatic recess, which is the largest and clinically most important recess, lies inferiorly between the thoracic wall and diaphragm. The superior thoracic aperture opens directly into the root of the neck (Fig. 3.7). The superior aspect of each pleural cavity extends approximately 2 to 3 cm above rib I and the costal cartilage into the neck. Between these pleural extensions, major visceral structures pass between the neck and superior mediastinum. In the midline, the trachea lies immediately anterior to the esophagus. Major blood vessels", "normally contain only a very thin layer of serous fluid. As a result, the surface of the lung, which is covered by visceral pleura, directly opposes and freely slides over the parietal pleura attached to the wall. The names given to the parietal pleura correspond to the parts of the wall with which they are associated (Fig. 3.38): Pleura related to the ribs and intercostal spaces is termed the costal part. Pleura covering the diaphragm is the diaphragmatic part. Pleura covering the mediastinum is the mediastinal part. The dome-shaped layer of parietal pleura lining the cervical extension of the pleural cavity is cervical pleura (dome of pleura or pleural cupola). Covering the superior surface of the cervical pleura is a distinct dome-like layer of fascia, the suprapleural membrane", "the diaphragm, at approximately the level of vertebra TVIII, the inferior vena cava enters the fibrous pericardium. A short portion of this vessel is within the pericardial sac before entering the right atrium. While within the pericardial sac, it is covered by serous pericardium except for a small portion of its posterior surface (Fig. 3.85B). A very short segment of each of the pulmonary veins is also within the pericardial sac. These veins, usually two from each lung, pass through the fibrous pericardium and enter the superior region of the left atrium on its posterior surface. In the pericardial sac, all but a portion of the posterior surface of these veins is covered by serous pericardium.

These postganglionic parasympathetic fibers have their origin in the otic ganglion associated with the mandibular nerve [V3] and are just inferior to the foramen ovale. Preganglionic parasympathetic fibers to the otic ganglion come from the glossopharyngeal nerve [IX]. During development a cranial nerve becomes associated with each of the pharyngeal arches.

These fibers are responsible for sensory innervation to all parts of the eyeball; however, the sympathetic fibers also may take alternative routes to the eyeball. The third branch to the ciliary ganglion is the most variable. This branch, when present, is the sympathetic root and contains postganglionic sympathetic fibers from the superior cervical ganglion (Fig. 8.107).

Because TSH levels change dynamically in response to alterations of T4 and T3, a logical approach to thyroid testing is to first determine whether TSH is suppressed, normal, or elevated. With rare exceptions (see below), a normal TSH level excludes a primary abnormality of thyroid function.

Bone remodeling occurs continually at about 2 million discrete sites throughout the skeleton by packets of bone cells referred to as the basic multicellular units (BMU). The cells involved in bone remodeling fall into two major classes: cells that form bone (osteoblasts) and cells that destroy or resorb bone (osteoclasts).

The process of bone remodeling is a highly integrated process ( Fig. 40.9 ). Osteoblast-lineage cells express factors that induce differentiation of osteoclasts from progenitors of the monocyte/ macrophage lineage and also promote mature osteoclast function. Osteoblasts release monocyte colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), which expands and differentiates early hematopoietic progenitors (CFU-GM) into preosteoclasts that express a cell surface receptor called RANK (receptor \u2022Fig. 40.9 Osteoblastregulationofosteoclastdifferentiationandfunction.(ModifiedfromPorterfieldSP,WhiteBA.Endocrine Physiology. 3rded.Philadelphia:Mosby;2007.) activator of nuclear factor [NF]-\u03baB).

Osteoclasts, located on the surface of bone, are specialized multinucleated macrophages, derived from circulating monocytes, which are responsible for bone resorption ( Fig. 21.2B ). By means of cell surface integrins, osteoclasts attach to bone matrix and create a sealed extracellular trench (resorption pit). The cells secrete acid and neutral proteases (predominantly matrix metalloproteases [MMPs]) into the pit, and these enzymes resorb the bone.

Surgical results are uniformly excel-lent for this defect, with survival approaching 100%.The utility of catheter-based intervention for this diagnosis remains controversial, although there have been some reports of successful balloon dilatation.87Aortopulmonary WindowEmbryology and Anatomy. Aortopulmonary window (APW) is a rare congenital lesion, occurring in about 0.2% of patients, characterized by incomplete development of the septum that normally divides the truncus into the aorta and the pulmonary artery88In the vast majority of cases, APW occurs as a single defect of minimal length, which begins a few millimeters above the semilunar valves on the left lateral wall of the aorta (Fig. 20-23). Coronary artery anomalies, such as aberrant origin of the right or left coronary artery from the main pulmonary artery, are occa-sionally present.Pathophysiology and Diagnosis. The", "cava to pass directly to the left atrium and so bypass the lungs, which are nonfunctional before birth. Finally, numerous small openings\u2014the openings of the smallest cardiac veins (the foramina of the venae cordis minimae)\u2014are scattered along the walls of the right atrium. These are small veins that drain the myocardium directly into the right atrium. In the anatomical position, the right ventricle forms most of the anterior surface of the heart and a portion of the diaphragmatic surface. The right atrium is to the right of the right ventricle and the right ventricle is located in front of and to the left of the right atrioventricular orifice. Blood entering the right ventricle from the right atrium therefore moves in a horizontal and forward direction. The outflow tract", "is diminutive and often less than 2 mm in diameter. The alternate technique available to provide pulmonary blood flow instead of a shunt is a RV-PA conduit often referred to as a \u201cSano.\u201d It is usually a 5 or 6 mm ribbed Gore-tex graft.113The postoperative management of infants following stage 1 palliation is complex because favorable outcomes depend on establishing a delicate balance between pulmonary and systemic perfusion. Recent literature suggests that these infants require adequate postoperative cardiac output in order to supply both the pulmonary and the systemic circulations and that the use of oxi-metric catheters to monitor mixed venous oxygen saturation (Svo2) aids clinicians in both the selection of inotropic agents and in ventilatory management.114 Introduction of a shunt between the RV and the pulmonary artery", "early survival rates, long-term problems, such as superior vena cava or pulmonary venous obstruction, baffle leak, arrhythmias, tricuspid valve regurgita-tion, and right ventricular failure, prompted the development of the arterial switch procedure by Jatene in 1975.143 The arterial switch procedure involves the division of the aorta and the pul-monary artery, posterior translocation of the aorta (LeCompte maneuver), mobilization of the coronary arteries, placement of a pantaloon-shaped pericardial patch, and proper alignment of the coronary arteries on the neoaorta (Fig. 20-50).The most important consideration is the timing of surgical repair because arterial switch should be performed within 2 weeks after birth, before the LV loses its ability to pump against sys-temic afterload. In patients presenting later than 2 weeks, the LV can be retrained with preliminary pulmonary artery banding", "the superior vena cava through the right atrium and into the inferior vena cava. This is a common route of access for such procedures as: transjugular liver biopsy, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS), and insertion of an inferior vena cava filter to catch emboli dislodged from veins in the lower limb and pelvis (i.e., patients with deep vein thrombosis [DVT]). In the clinic Coarctation of the aorta Coarctation of the aorta is a congenital abnormality in which the aortic lumen is constricted just distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery. At this point, the aorta becomes significantly narrowed and the blood supply to the lower limbs and abdomen is diminished. Over time, collateral vessels develop around the chest wall and abdomen to supply the lower body."]}, {"id": "seed_task_9999", "name": "MMLU_test_anatomy", "is_classification": true, "instruction": "In this task, you are given a question and four different answer options.

Ribs XI and XII have no anterior connection with other ribs or with the sternum and are often called floating ribs.

The adult sternum consists of three major elements: the broad and superiorly positioned manubrium of the sternum, the narrow and longitudinally oriented body of the sternum, and the small and inferiorly positioned xiphoid process (Fig. 3.23).

Ribs XI and XII are called floating ribs because they do not articulate with other ribs, costal cartilages, or the sternum. Their costal cartilages are small, only covering their tips. The skeletal framework of the thoracic wall provides extensive attachment sites for muscles of the neck, abdomen, back, and upper limbs. A number of these muscles attach to ribs and function as accessory respiratory muscles; some of them also stabilize the position of the first and last ribs. Completely surrounded", "process often becomes ossified with age. A clinically useful feature of the manubriosternal joint is that it can be palpated easily. This is because the manubrium normally angles posteriorly on the body of the sternum, forming a raised feature referred to as the sternal angle. This elevation marks the site of articulation of rib II with the sternum. Rib I is not palpable, because it lies inferior to the clavicle and is embedded in tissues at the base of the neck. Therefore, rib II is used as a reference for counting ribs and can be felt immediately lateral to the sternal angle. In addition, the sternal angle lies on a horizontal plane that passes through the intervertebral disc between vertebrae TIV and TV (see Fig. 3.10).

The skeletal elements of the thoracic wall consist of the thoracic vertebrae, intervertebral discs, ribs, and sternum. There are twelve thoracic vertebrae, each of which is characterized by articulations with ribs.

A left subcostal incision paralleling the left costal margin and lying two finger-breadths below it is preferred for most elective splenectomies. A midline incision is optimal for exposure when the spleen is ruptured or massively enlarged. The spleen is mobilized by dividing ligamentous attachments, usually beginning with the splenocolic ligament (Fig. 34-6). In patients with signifi-cant splenomegaly, once lesser sac access has been achieved through either the gastrosplenic or gastrohepatic attachments, ligating the splenic artery in continuity along the superior bor-der of the pancreas may be preferable. This maneuver may serve several purposes: allowing safer manipulation of the Figure 34-6.

As noted in the discussion of splenic anatomy, the tail of the pancreas lies within 1 cm of the splenic hilum in 75% of patients; therefore, during hilar dissec-tion, great care must be taken to avoid injuring the pancreas. Once the spleen is excised, hemostasis is secured by irrigating, suctioning, and scrupulously inspecting the bed of dissection. The splenic bed is not routinely drained. A thorough search for accessory spleens must be undertaken when a hematologic disorder has occasioned splenectomy.

Plain films can indirectly provide an outline of the spleen in the left upper quadrant or suggest splenomegaly by revealing dis-placement of adjacent air-filled structures (e.g., the stomach or splenic flexure of the colon). Plain films may also demonstrate splenic calcifications. Splenic calcifications often are found in association with splenomegaly but are otherwise a nonspe-cific finding.

In knees, meniscal degeneration is part of the disease. There are numerous pathways that lead to joint failure, but the initial step is often joint injury in the setting of a failure of protective mechanisms. Joint protectors include joint capsule and ligaments, muscle, sensory afferents, and underlying bone. Joint capsule and ligaments serve as joint protectors by providing a limit to excursion, thereby fixing the range of joint motion. Synovial fluid reduces", "the joint space and joint fluid likely triggers synovial 2230 inflammation, which can, in turn, produce release of enzymes and trigger nociceptive stimulation. Because cartilage is aneural, cartilage loss in a joint is not accompanied by pain. Thus, pain in OA likely arises from structures outside the cartilage. Innervated structures in the joint include the synovium, ligaments, joint capsule, muscles, and subchondralbone.Mostof these are not visualized by the x-ray, and the severity of x-ray changes in OA correlates poorly with pain severity. Based on MRI studies in osteoarthritic knees comparing those with and without pain and on studies mapping tenderness in unanesthetized joints, likely sources of pain include synovial inflammation, joint effusions, and bone marrow edema.

The synovial membrane is highly vascular and produces synovial fluid, which percolates into the articular cavity and lubricates the articulating surfaces. Closed sacs of synovial membrane also occur outside joints, where they form synovial bursae or tendon sheaths. Bursae often intervene between structures, such as tendons and bone, tendons and joints, or skin and bone, and reduce the friction of one structure moving over the other. Tendon sheaths surround tendons and also reduce friction. The fibrous membrane is formed by dense connective tissue and surrounds and stabilizes the", "Articular structures include the synovium, synovial fluid, articular cartilage, intraarticular ligaments, joint capsule, and juxtaarticular bone. Nonarticular (or periarticular) structures, such as supportive extraarticular ligaments, tendons, bursae, muscle, fascia, bone, nerve, and overlying skin, may be involved in the pathologic process. Although musculoskeletal complaints are often ascribed to the joints, nonarticular disorders more frequently underlie such complaints. Distinguishing between these potential sources of pain may be challenging to the unskilled examiner. Articular disorders may be characterized by deep or diffuse pain, pain or limited range of motion on active and passive movement, and swelling (caused by synovial proliferation, effusion, or bony enlargement), crepitation, instability, \u201clocking,\u201d or deformity.

The fibrous membrane is formed by dense connective tissue and surrounds and stabilizes the joint. Parts of the fibrous membrane may thicken to form ligaments, which further stabilize the joint. Ligaments outside the capsule usually provide additional reinforcement. Another common but not universal feature of synovial joints is the presence of additional structures within the area enclosed by the capsule or synovial membrane, such as articular discs (usually composed of fibrocartilage), fat pads, and tendons. Articular discs absorb compression forces, adjust to changes in the contours of joint surfaces during movements, and increase the range of movements that can occur at joints.

Descriptions of synovial joints based on shape and movement Synovial joints are described based on shape and movement: based on the shape of their articular surfaces, synovial joints are described as plane (flat), hinge, pivot, bicondylar (two sets of contact points), condylar (ellipsoid), saddle, and ball and socket; based on movement, synovial joints are described as uniaxial (movement in one plane), biaxial (movement in two", "are separated by a narrow articular cavity (Fig. 1.19). In addition to containing an articular cavity, these joints have a number of characteristic features. First, a layer of cartilage, usually hyaline cartilage, covers the articulating surfaces of the skeletal elements. In other words, bony surfaces do not normally contact one another directly. As a consequence, when these joints are viewed in normal radiographs, a wide gap seems to separate the adjacent bones because the cartilage that covers the articulating surfaces is more transparent to X-rays than bone. A second characteristic feature of synovial joints is the presence of a joint capsule consisting of an inner synovial membrane and an outer fibrous membrane. The synovial membrane attaches to the margins of the joint surfaces at the interface between the", "anterolateral surface of the arytenoid cartilage and anteriorly to the thyroid angle just superior to the attachment of the vocal ligament. On each side, the vestibular ligament of the quadrangular membrane is separated from the vocal ligament of the cricothyroid ligament below by a gap. Because the vestibular ligament attaches to the anterolateral surface of the arytenoid cartilage and the vocal ligament attaches to the vocal process of the same cartilage, the vestibular ligament is lateral to the vocal ligament when viewed from above (Fig. 8.218). The joints between the inferior horns of the thyroid cartilage and the cricoid cartilage, and between the cricoid cartilage and arytenoid cartilages are synovial.

The sternoclavicular joint is surrounded by a joint capsule and is reinforced by four ligaments: The anterior and posterior sternoclavicular ligaments are anterior and posterior, respectively, to the joint. An interclavicular ligament links the ends of the two clavicles to each other and to the superior surface of the manubrium of the sternum.

It occurs because the arachnoid mater clings to the inner surface of the dura mater and does not follow the contour of the brain, while the pia mater, being against the surface of the brain, closely follows the grooves and fissures on the surface of the brain. The narrow subarachnoid space is therefore created between these two membranes (Fig. 8.35). The subarachnoid space surrounds the brain and spinal cord and in certain locations it enlarges into expanded areas (subarachnoid", "and evacuate the clot before coma has developed. Treatment of larger hematomas, particularly after several hours have passed and the blood has clotted, consists of craniotomy to permit control of the bleeding and removal of the clot.

Thin, crescentic clots can be observed and followed over several weeks and surgery undertaken only if focal signs or indications of increasing ICP arise (headache, vomiting, and bradycardia).

The injury, even when it fractures the skull, may not have produced coma initially, or it may be part of a devastating craniocerebral injury.

A blow to the skull that exceeds the elastic tolerance of the bone causes a fracture. Intracranial lesions accompany roughly two-thirds of skull fractures, and the presence of a fracture increases many-fold the chances of an underlying subdural or epidural hematoma. Consequently, fractures are primarily markers of the site and severity of injury. If the underlying arachnoid membrane has been torn, fractures also provide potential pathways for entry of bacteria to the CSF with a risk of meningitis and for leakage of CSF outward through the dura.

Only a sizable brain abscess or substantial brain swelling entirely interdicts a lumbar puncture in suspected bacterial meningitis.

The inferior alveolar nerve passes into the mandibular canal, courses through the body of the mandible, and eventually", "[V3]. The gingiva on the buccal side of the upper teeth is innervated by the anterior, middle, and superior alveolar nerves, which also innervate the adjacent teeth. Gingiva on the palatal (lingual) side of the same teeth is innervated by the nasopalatine and the greater palatine nerves: The nasopalatine nerve innervates gingiva associated with the incisor and canine teeth. The greater palatine nerve supplies gingiva associated with the remaining teeth. The gingiva associated with the (buccal) side of the mandibular incisor, canine, and premolar teeth is innervated by the mental branch of the inferior alveolar nerve. Gingiva on the buccal side of the mandibular molar teeth is innervated by the buccal nerve, which originates in the infratemporal fossa from the mandibular nerve [V3]. Gingiva adjacent to the lingual", "and gingiva as far as the first premolar. The lesser palatine nerve passes posteromedially to supply the soft palate. The nasopalatine nerve also originates in the pterygopalatine fossa, but passes medially into the nasal cavity. It continues medially over the roof of the nasal cavity to reach the medial wall, then anteriorly and obliquely down the wall to reach the incisive canal in the anterior floor, and descends through the incisive canal and fossa to reach the inferior surface of the hard palate (Fig. 8.276). The nasopalatine nerve supplies gingiva and mucosa adjacent to the incisors and canine. The oral fissure is the slit-like opening between the lips that connects the oral vestibule to the outside (Fig. 8.277). It can be opened and closed, and altered in shape", "(lingual or palatal side): Buccal gingiva of the lower teeth is supplied by branches from the inferior alveolar artery, whereas the lingual side is supplied by branches from the lingual artery of the tongue. Buccal gingiva of the upper teeth is supplied by branches of the anterior and posterior superior alveolar arteries. Palatal gingiva is supplied by branches from the nasopalatine (incisor and canine teeth) and greater palatine (premolar and molar teeth) arteries. Veins from the upper and lower teeth generally follow the arteries (Fig. 8.279). Inferior alveolar veins from the lower teeth, and superior alveolar veins from the upper teeth drain mainly into the pterygoid plexus of veins in the infratemporal fossa, although some drainage from the anterior teeth may be via tributaries of the facial vein.", "surrounding regions, mainly the upper lip and cheek to recreate the lip. This can be accomplished using an Abbe (lip switch) (Fig. 18-23) or Karapandzic flap (Fig. 18-24), if the commissure is preserved, or an Estlander flap (lip switch) if the commissure is resected. If there is insufficient lip tissue, rectangular excisions can be closed using upper Burrow\u2019s triangles in combination with bilateral advancement flaps made possible by mental crease relaxing incisions; this technique is called Bernard-Burrow (Fig. 18-25).112 When more than two-thirds of the lip is excised, the Karapandzic can still be used when the defect is up to 80% as this provides a sensate lip with sphincter-like function; however, microstomia becomes a serious concern, and larger defects require free flap reconstruction.

The proportion of the lip excised and whether the defect involves the oral commissure determines the reconstructive options. Regardless of the reconstructive technique, realignment of the vermilion border and reapproximation of the orbicularis oris are critical steps to a successful outcome. Defects of less than one-third of the lip are closed primarily, while defects between one-third and two-thirds of the lip borrow tissue from surrounding regions, mainly the upper lip and cheek to recreate the lip.

In one, and by far the more common group, the cognitive limitation is relatively mild, allowing the individual to succeed with therapy and education; it is often familial and is featured by a lack of definite neurologic abnormalities (except possibly a slightly higher incidence of seizures) and the absence of neuropathologic changes.

However, it seems reasonable to attempt withdrawal of therapy after 2 years in a patient who meets all of the above criteria, is motivated to discontinue the medication, and clearly understands the potential risks and benefits. In most cases, it is preferable to reduce the dose of the drug gradually over 2\u20133 months. Most recurrences occur in the first 3 months after discontinuing therapy, and patients should be advised to avoid potentially dangerous situations such as driving or swimming during this period. Approximately one-third of patients with epilepsy do not respond to treatment with a single antiepileptic drug, and it becomes necessary to try a combination of drugs to control seizures. Patients who have focal epilepsy related to an underlying structural", "it is equivalently deleterious to make a patient so mentally dull as to interfere with function at work or school. The choice and dose of medication depends on many factors including sex, age, other medications, and renal or hepatic dysfunction or other medical conditions and psychiatric conditions that might be favorably influenced by a particular agent. As a general rule, starting in the lower dose range and attempting to provide twice daily or daily administration are favored. In approximately 70 percent of all patients with epilepsy, the seizures are controlled completely or almost completely by medications; in an additional 20 to 25 percent, the attacks are significantly reduced in number and severity. In a series reported by Kwan and Brodie approximately 20 years ago but probably still reflecting", "the choice of drug in certain common forms of epilepsy is given in Table 15-6 for adults and Table 15-7 for children, but it must be noted that there are a number of drugs that may be appropriate in each circumstance.

These are more restrictive than are found in general use but it is worthwhile being familiar with the standing of various medications. A tabular summary of these approvals, main uses, and their dates of inception that divide the agents into three generations can be found in a review by Schmidt that is current as of 2016.

Each section also includes a brief description of the minimal examination necessary to adequately screen for abnormalities in a patient who has no symptoms suggesting neurologic dysfunction.

However, the differences became less significant over time and the side effects of the medications, as judged by practical factors such as keeping a job, were no different between groups. The death rates were comparable. Therefore, factors such as tolerance of the medications, patient preferences, and nature of work must be taken into account when making decisions regarding antiepileptic medicines.

Terminal bronchioles terminate in an opening (duct) to a group of alveoli and are called respiratory bronchioles. The region of the lung supplied by a segmental bronchus is called a bronchopulmonary segment and is the functional anatomical unit of the lung. Because of their structure, bronchopulmonary segments that have become irreversibly diseased can easily be removed surgically. The basic physiological unit of the lung is the gas-exchanging unit (respiratory unit), which consists of the respiratory bronchioles, the alveolar ducts, and the alveoli (see Figs. 20.4 20.5). The bronchi, which contain cartilage, and the terminal bronchioles (i.e., lacking alveoli), in which cartilage is absent, serve to move gas from the airways to the alveoli and are referred to as the conducting airways. This area", "by cuboidal epithelium. The epithelium of the initial segments of the respiratory bronchioles contains both ciliated cells and Clara cells (see Fig. 19.12). Distally, Clara cells predominate. Occasional brush cells and dense-core granule cells are also present along the length of the respiratory bronchiole. Scattered, thin-walled outpocketings, alveoli, extend from the lumen of the respiratory bronchioles (see Fig. 19.11). Alveoli are the sites at which air leaves and enters the bron chiole to allow gas exchange. Alveoli are the site of gas exchange. The surface area available for gas exchange is increased by the lung alveoli. Alveoli are the terminal air spaces of the respiratory system and are the actual sites of gas exchange between the air and the blood. Each alveolus is surrounded by a network of", "until ending in the alveolus ( Fig. 20.5 ). Bronchi and bronchioles differ not only in size but also by the presence of cartilage, the type of epithelium, and their blood supply ( Table 20.1). Beyond the segmental bronchi, the airways divide in a dichotomous or asymmetrical branching pattern. Bronchi, distinguished by their size and the presence of cartilage, eventually become terminal bronchioles, which are the smallest airways without alveoli. Each branching of an airway results in an increase in the number of airways with smaller diameters; as a result, the total surface area for the next generation of branches increases. Terminal bronchioles terminate in an opening (duct) to a group of alveoli and are called respiratory bronchioles. The region of the lung supplied by a segmental bronchus", "they follow the bronchial tree into the substance of the lung. Capillaries come into intimate contact with the terminal respiratory units, the alveoli. This intimate relationship between the alveolar air spaces and the pulmonary capillaries is the structural basis for gas exchange within the lung parenchyma. The essential features of the lung blood supply are described on page 687. Air passing through the respiratory passages must be conditioned before reaching the terminal respiratory units. Conditioning of the air occurs in the conducting portion of the respiratory system and includes warming, moistening, and removal of particulate materials. Mucous and serous secretions play a major role in the conditioning process. These secretions moisten the air and also trap particles that have managed to slip past the special short thick hairs,", "last portion of a bronchiole that leads into respiratory bronchioles is called a terminal bronchiole. It is not engaged in exchange of air with the blood; the respiratory bronchiole does engage in air exchange. Arrows mark the place where the terminal bronchiole ends. Not uncommonly, as shown here, cartilage (C ) is found in the bronchiolar wall where branching occurs. Blood vessels (BV ) and a nodule of lymphocytes (L) are adjacent to the bronchiole. The respiratory bronchiole has a wall composed of two components: One consists of recesses that have a wall similar to that of the alveoli and are thus capable of gas exchange; the other has a wall formed by small cuboidal cells that appear to rest on a small bundle of eosinophilic material. This", "(Fig. 306e-3). An important anatomic feature of the pulmonary airways is its treelike branching structure. While the individual airways in each successive generation, from most proximal (trachea) to most distal (respiratory bronchioles), are smaller than those of the parent generation, their number increases exponentially such that the summed cross-sectional area of the airways becomes very large toward the lung periphery. Because flow (volume/time) is constant along the airway tree, the velocity of airflow (flow/summed cross-sectional area) is much greater in the central airways than in the peripheral airways. During exhalation, gas leaving the alveoli must therefore gain velocity as it proceeds toward the mouth. The energy required for this \u201cconvective\u201d acceleration is drawn from the component of gas energy manifested as its local pressure, which reduces intraluminal gas", "from the aorta, supplies all of the lung tissue other than the alveoli (i.e., the walls of the bronchi and bronchioles and the connective tissue of the lung other than that of the alveolar septum). The finest branches of the bronchial arterial tree also open into the pulmonary capillaries. Therefore, the bronchial and pulmonary circulations anastomose at about the level of the junction between the conducting and respiratory passages. Bronchial veins drain only the connective tissue of the hilar region of the lungs. Most of the blood reaching the lungs via the bronchial arteries leaves the lungs via the pulmonary veins. A dual lymphatic drainage of the lungs parallels the dual blood supply. One set of lymphatic vessels drains the parenchyma of the lung and follows the air", "not present in left lungFigure 19-7.

The tracheobronchial tree consists of approximately 23 airway divisions to the level of the alveoli. It includes the main bronchi, lobar bronchi, segmental bronchi (to designated bronchopulmo-nary segments), and terminal bronchioles (i.e., the smallest air-ways still lined by bronchial epithelium and without alveoli). The tracheobronchial tree is normally lined by pseudostratified ciliated columnar", "or a persistent nonproductive cough. Hemoptysis, wheezing, and chest pain may be present. Often, the identification of interstitial opacities on chest x-ray focuses the diagnostic approach on one of the ILDs.

All injuries should be evaluated for nearby wounds (open) that may introduce bacteria into the fracture site or joint space.Once the initial force on the fracture ceases, the tendons passing beyond the fracture site provide the principal deforming force.

Salpingo-oophorectomy was once considered appropriate because it was theorized that this technique would eliminate transperitoneal migration of the ovum or zygote, which was thought to predispose to recurrent ectopic pregnancy (179). Ovarian removal results in all ovulations occurring on the side with the remaining normal fallopian tube. Subsequent studies have not confirmed that ipsilateral oophorectomy increases the likelihood of conceiving an intrauterine pregnancy; therefore, this practice is not recommended (180). Whether to treat the ectopic pregnancy with a salpingostomy or salpingectomy is strongly debated and multiple studies investigated this issue. If one surgical technique resulted in higher treatment efficacy, lower rates of recurrent ectopic pregnancies, and higher rates of future intrauterine pregnancies, the decision would be clear.

Distal Tubal Occlusion (Excluding Sterilization or Hydrosalpinx) Distal tubal disease and occlusion are causal in 85% of all tubal infertility and can be secondary to a variety of in\ufb02ammatory conditions including infection, endometriosis, or prior abdominal or pelvic surgery (211,223). Patients younger than 35 years of age with mild distal tubal disease, normal tubal mucosa, and absent or minimal pelvic adhesions are the best candidates for corrective microsurgery (223).

Uterine Factors Pathologies within the uterine cavity are the cause of infertility in as many as 15% of couples seeking treatment and are diagnosed in greater than 50% of infertile patients (231). Therefore, the evaluation of the couple with infertility should consistently include an assessment of the endometrial cavity. Uterine cavity abnormalities include endometrial polyps, endometrial hyperplasia, submucous myomas, intrauterine synechiae, and congenital uterine anomalies (232).

Simply put, the papillary muscles and associated chordae tendineae keep the valves closed during the dramatic changes in ventricular size that occur during contraction. In addition, chordae tendineae from two papillary muscles attach to each cusp. This helps prevent separation of the cusps during ventricular contraction. Proper closing of the tricuspid valve causes blood to exit the right ventricle and move into the pulmonary trunk. Necrosis of a papillary muscle following a myocardial infarction (heart attack) may result in prolapse of the related valve. At the apex of the infundibulum, the outflow tract of the right ventricle, the opening into the pulmonary trunk is closed by the pulmonary valve (Fig. 3.71), which consists of three semilunar cusps with free edges projecting upward into", "the unidirectional flow of blood through the heart. There are two types of valves in the heart: atrioventricular and semilunar ( Figs. 16.40 16.41 The tricuspid valve, located between the right atrium and the right ventricle, is made up of three cusps, whereas the mitral valve, which lies between the left atrium and the left ventricle, has two cusps. The total area of the cusps of each AV valve is approximately twice that of the respective AV orifice, and so considerable overlap of the leaflets occurs when the valves are in the closed position. Attached to the free edges of these valves are fine, strong ligaments (chordae tendineae cordis) that arise from the powerful papillary muscles of the respective ventricles. These ligaments prevent the valves from becoming everted", "barely exceeds ventricular pressure. This small pressure difference indicates that the pathway through the open AV valves during ventricular filling has low resistance. Because there are no valves at the junction of the venae cavae and right atrium or at the junction of the pulmonary veins and left atrium, atrial contraction may force blood in both directions. However, little blood is actually pumped back into the venous tributaries during the brief atrial contraction, mainly because of the inertia of the inflowing blood. The contribution of atrial contraction to ventricular filling is governed to a great extent by the heart rate and the position of the AV valves. At slow heart rates, filling practically ceases toward the end of diastasis, and atrial contraction contributes little additional filling. During tachycardia,", "agent shifts the function from A to D because of excessive venodilation or administration of diuretics, the cardiac output may decrease too much, even though the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure would be normal (10 mm Hg) for a normal heart. Left ventricular end-diastolic pressures of 15 to 18 mm Hg are usually optimal in the failing heart to maximize cardiac output, but to avoid pulmonary edema.

The score accounts for the degree of leaflet thickening, calcification, and mobility, and for the extent of subvalvular thickening. A lower score predicts a higher likelihood of successful PMBV. In patients in whom PMBV is not possible or unsuccessful, or in many patients with restenosis after previous surgery, an \u201copen\u201d valvotomy using cardiopulmonary bypass is necessary. In addition to opening the valve commissures, it is important to loosen any subvalvular fusion of papillary muscles and chordae tendineae; to remove large deposits of calcium, thereby improving valvular function; and to remove atrial thrombi. The perioperative mortality rate is ~2%. Successful valvotomy is defined by a 50% reduction in the mean mitral valve gradient and", "in CS and/or pulmonary edema. This complication most often occurs on the first day, with a second peak several days later. The diagnosis is confirmed by echo-Doppler. Rapid stabilization with IABP is recommended, with administration of dobutamine as needed to raise cardiac output. Reducing the load against which the LV pumps (afterload) reduces the volume of regurgitant flow of blood into the left atrium. Mitral valve surgery is the definitive therapy and should be performed early in the course in suitable candidates. (See also Chap. 295) Echo-Doppler demonstrates shunting of blood from the left to the right ventricle and may visualize the opening in the interventricular septum.

This artery, through its cortical branches, supplies the anterior three-quarters of the medial surface of the frontal lobe, including its medial-orbital surface, the frontal pole, a strip of the lateral surface of the cerebral hemisphere along its superior border, and the anterior four-fifths of the corpus callosum. Most strokes are of the embolic variety, far less often atherosclerotic, and occasionally due to other processes such as vasospasm or vasculitis.

If there is no collateral flow from the carotid system via the circle of Willis, occlusion of one functional vertebral artery is equivalent to occlusion of the basilar artery (see below). The posteroinferior cerebellar artery (PICA) is usually a branch of the vertebral artery but can have a common origin and form a loop with the anteroinferior cerebellar artery (AICA) from the basilar artery. It is necessary to keep these anatomic variations in mind in considering the effects of vertebral artery occlusion. The vertebral artery is assigned four numerical segments for convenience of explication. They are: V1, from the origin to the first entry into the cervical transverse foramen (usually C6 as noted); V2, from the transverse", "arteries, and the proximal portions of the anterior and posterior cerebral arteries together form a network of such redundancy that infarction of the hypothalamus is very infrequent.

There are also fibers that reach the motor area from the limbic system, presumably subserving motivation and attention.

Thus the prefrontal cortex, supplementary motor cortex, premotor cortex, and motor cortex are all responsive to afferent stimuli and are involved prior to, and in coordinated fashion with, a complex movement.

If curable malignancy is suspected, more radical resections, such as a right hemicolectomy, are gener-ally indicated. The ileocolic vessels are ligated and divided. A variable length of small intestine may be resected depending on the disease process. A primary anastomosis is created between the distal small bowel and the ascending colon. It is technically difficult to perform an anastomosis at or just proximal to the ileocecal valve; therefore, if the most distal ileum needs to be resected, the cecum is generally also removed.Right Colectomy A right colectomy is used to remove lesions or disease in the", "from the ileum; the proximal 40% of the jejunoileal segment is arbitrarily defined as the jejunum and the distal 60% as the ileum. The ileum is demarcated from the cecum by the ileocecal valve.The small intestine contains internal mucosal folds known as plicae circulares or valvulae conniventes that are visible upon gross inspection. These folds are also visible radiographically and help in the distinction between small intestine and colon, which does not contain them, on abdominal radiographs. These folds are more prominent in the proximal intestine than in the distal small intestine.

Crohn\u2019s disease, however, may affect any portion of the intestinal tract, from mouth to anus. Diagnosis may be made by colonoscopy or esophagogastroduo-denoscopy or by barium small bowel study or enema, depending on which part of the intestine is most affected. The presence of skip lesions is key in differentiating Crohn\u2019s colitis from ulcer-ative colitis, and rectal sparing occurs in approximately 40% of patients. The most common site of involvement of Crohn\u2019s dis-ease is the terminal ileum and cecum (ileocolic Crohn\u2019s disease), followed by the small bowel, and", "colon is the narrowest part of the large intestine and is extremely mobile. Although the sigmoid colon is usually located in the left lower quadrant, redundancy and mobility can result in a portion of the sigmoid colon residing in the right lower quadrant. This mobility explains why volvulus is most common in the sigmoid colon and why diseases affect-ing the sigmoid colon, such as diverticulitis, may occasionally present as right-sided abdominal pain. The narrow caliber of the sigmoid colon makes this segment of the large intestine the most vulnerable to obstruction.Colon Vascular Supply. The arterial supply to the colon is highly variable (Fig. 29-1). In general, the superior mesenteric artery branches into the ileocolic artery (absent in up to 20% of people), which supplies blood flow to the", "the ileocecal valve; therefore, if the most distal ileum needs to be resected, the cecum is generally also removed.Right Colectomy A right colectomy is used to remove lesions or disease in the right colon and is oncologically the most appro-priate operation for curative intent resection of proximal colon carcinoma. The ileocolic vessels, right colic vessels, and right branches of the middle colic vessels are ligated and divided. Approximately 10 cm of terminal ileum are usually included in the resection. A primary ileal-transverse colon anastomosis is almost always possible.Extended Right Colectomy An extended right colectomy may be used for curative intent resection of lesions located at the hepatic flexure or proximal transverse colon. A standard right colectomy is extended to include ligation of the middle colic vessels at their", "a dilated colon and enlarging cecum, further evaluation of the large bowel is required by barium enema or colonoscopy. Dilation of the cecum to more than 10 to 12 cm in diameter as viewed by abdominal radiography requires immediate evaluation and surgical decompression by performing colectomy or colostomy. Surgery should be performed as soon as the obstruction is documented. Conservative management of colonic obstruction is not appropriate because the complication of colonic perforation has an exceedingly high mortality rate. In patients who are too ill to undergo surgery, the interventional radiologist may be able to place a cecostomy tube or the gastroenterologist may place a colonic stent (124). Diarrhea Episodes of diarrhea often occur following abdominal and pelvic surgery as the gastrointestinal tract returns to its normal function", "availability and low cost (Fig. 28-12).Computed tomographic (CT) scanning is becoming increasingly the imaging test of choice for patients with small bowel obstruction, and it is ideally done with oral contrast. CT is 80% to 90% sensitive and 70% to 90% specific in the detec-tion of small bowel obstruction. The findings of small bowel obstruction include a discrete transition zone with dilation of bowel proximally, decompression of bowel distally, intralumi-nal contrast that does not pass beyond the transition zone, and a colon containing little gas or fluid (Figs. 28-13 and 28-14). CT scanning may also provide evidence for the presence of closed-loop obstruction and strangulation. Closed-loop obstruction is suggested by the presence of a U-shaped or C-shaped dilated bowel loop associated with a radial distribution of mesenteric vessels", "qualified radiologist, sensitivity appears to be as good as colonoscopy for colorectal cancers and polyps greater than 1 cm in size.103 Colonoscopy is required if a lesion is identified. CT colonography has also been used for imag-ing the proximal colon in cases of obstruction or if a colonos-copy cannot be completed in selected patients. Limitations of this technique include false-positive results from retained stool, diverticular disease, haustral folds, motion artifacts, and an inability to detect flat adenomas.Guidelines for Screening. Current American Cancer Society guidelines advocate screening for the average-risk population (asymptomatic, no family history of colorectal carcinoma, no personal history of polyps or colorectal carcinoma, no familial syndrome) beginning at age 50 years. Recommended proce-dures include yearly FOBT/FIT, flexible sigmoidoscopy every Table 29-1Advantages and disadvantages of screening modalities", "blood noted on endoscopy examination suggests strangulation and is an indication for operation. If dead bowel is present at laparotomy, a sigmoid colectomy with end colostomy (Hartmann\u2019s procedure) may be the safest operation to perform.Cecal Volvulus. Cecal volvulus results from nonfixation of the right colon. In the majority of cases, rotation occurs around the ileocolic blood vessels and vascular impairment occurs early, although 10% to 30% of the cecum folds upon itself (cecal bascule). Plain X-rays of the abdomen show a characteristic kidney-shaped, air-filled structure in the left upper quadrant (opposite the site of obstruction), and a Gastrografin enema confirms obstruction at the level of the volvulus.Unlike sigmoid volvulus, cecal volvulus can almost never be detorsed endoscopically.

In this set-ting, the bowel is almost always unprepared and the patient may be unstable. The surgical principles described earlier apply, and an attempt should be made to resect the involved segment along with its lymphovascular supply. If the resection involves the right colon or proximal transverse colon (right or extended right colectomy), a primary ileocolonic anastomosis can usually be performed safely as long as the remaining bowel appears healthy and the patient is stable.

In cases of pernicious anemia, the patient is given 1,000 \u00b5g of cyanocobalamin or hydroxocobalamin intramuscularly each day for several days. The usual approach is to repeat the injection weekly for a month and then monthly for an indefinite period.

Vitamin B12 injections are used in a wide variety of diseases, often neurologic, despite normal serum B12 and folate levels and a normal blood count and in the absence of randomized, double-blind, controlled trials.

Replenishment of body stores should be complete with six 1000-\u03bcg IM injections of hydroxocobalamin given at 3to 7-day intervals. More frequent doses are usually used in patients with cobalamin neuropathy, but there is no evidence that they produce a better response.

B12 is taken up and stored in the liver, primarily. It is released into bile and efficiently reabsorbed in the ileum. Severe malabsorption of vitamin B12 leads to pernicious anemia. This disease is most commonly a result of an autoimmune destruction of the gastric parietal cells that are responsible for the synthesis of IF (lack of IF prevents B12 absorption). [Note: Patients who have had a partial or total gastrectomy become IF deficient and, therefore, B12 deficient.] Individuals with cobalamin deficiency are usually anemic (folate recycling is impaired), and they show neuropsychiatric symptoms as the disease develops.

In a few instances, the underlying cause of cobalamin deficiency can be permanently corrected, e.g., fish tapeworm, tropical sprue, or an intestinal stagnant loop that is amenable to surgery. The indications for starting cobalamin therapy are a well-documented megaloblastic anemia or other hematologic abnormalities and neuropathy due to the deficiency. Patients with borderline serum cobalamin levels but no hematologic or other abnormality may be followed to make sure that the cobalamin deficiency does not progress (see below).

It is noteworthy that vitamin B12-deprived monkeys do not become anemic despite the prolonged period of vitamin B12 deficiency. Also in distinction to the human condition, involvement of the optic nerves is particularly severe in the monkey and probably precedes the degeneration of the spinal cord. The optic nerve lesions appear first in the papillomacular bundles, in the retrobulbar portions of the nerves; it subsequently spreads beyond the confines of this bundle and caudally in the optic nerves, chiasm, and tracts.

Like the visceral motor nerves of the sympathetic part, the visceral motor nerves of the parasympathetic part generally have two neurons in the pathway. The preganglionic neurons are in the CNS, and fibers leave in the cranial nerves.

In the spinal cord, visceral components are associated mainly with spinal cord levels T1 to L2 and S2 to S4. Visceral motor components associated with spinal levels T1 to L2 are termed sympathetic. Those visceral motor components in cranial and sacral regions, on either side of the sympathetic region, are termed parasympathetic: The sympathetic system innervates structures in peripheral regions of the body and viscera. The parasympathetic system is more restricted to innervation of the viscera only. Spinal sympathetic and spinal parasympathetic neurons share certain developmental and phenotypic features that are different from those of", "thoracic and the second lumbar segments (Fig. 454-1). These are thinly myelinated. The postganglionic neurons, located in ganglia outside the CNS, give rise to the postganglionic unmyelinated autonomic nerves that innervate organs and tissues throughout the body. Responses to sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulation are frequently antagonistic (Table 454-1), reflecting highly coordinated interactions within the CNS; the resultant changes in parasympathetic and sympathetic activity provide more precise control of autonomic responses than could be achieved by the modulation of a single system. Acetylcholine (ACh) is the preganglionic neurotransmitter for both divisions of the ANS as well as the postganglionic neurotransmitter from cranial nerves III, VII, IX, X from T1-L2 and from sacral nerves 2 and 3 Preganglionic fibers Postganglionic fibers in the heart wall FIGURE 454-1 Schematic representation of", "parasympathetic part of the autonomic division of the PNS.

They leave the spinal cord in the ventral root and enter the paravertebral ganglion at the same segmental level through a white communicating ramus. White rami are found only from the levels of T1 to L2. The preganglionic axon may synapse on postganglionic neurons in the ganglion at its level of entry; may travel rostrally or caudally within the sympathetic trunk and give off collaterals to the ganglia that it passes; or may pass through the ganglion, exit the sympathetic trunk, and enter a splanchnic nerve to travel to a prevertebral", "by visceral sensory fibers. Nerve plexuses are either somatic or visceral and combine fibers from different sources or levels to form new nerves with specific targets or destinations (Fig. 1.49). Plexuses of the enteric system also generate reflex activity independent of the CNS. Major somatic plexuses formed from the anterior rami of spinal nerves are the cervical (C1 to C4), brachial (C5 to T1), lumbar (L1 to L4), sacral (L4 to S4), and coccygeal (S5 to Co) plexuses. Except for spinal nerve T1, the anterior rami of thoracic spinal nerves remain independent and do not participate in plexuses.

However, visceral sensory fibers may also enter the spinal cord at levels other than those associated with motor output. For example, visceral sensory fibers from the heart may enter at levels higher than spinal cord level T1.

The pupillary change may be subtle and may require covering the eyes or dimming the room lights to observe the lack of expected mydriasis on one side. Most cases are caused by peripheral interruption of the sympathetic chain but the same effect may be produced by ipsilateral lesions of the sympathetic tract in the medulla or cervical cord.

Occasionally, patients feel a full sensation within the orbit when blowing the nose. In the clinic Horner\u2019s syndrome is caused by any lesion that leads to a loss of sympathetic function in the head. It is characterized by three typical features: pupillary constriction due to paralysis of the dilator pupillae muscle, partial ptosis (drooping of the upper eyelid) due to paralysis of the superior tarsal muscle, and absence of sweating on the ipsilateral side of the face and the neck due to absence of innervation of the sweat glands.

With lesions distal to the carotid bifurcation, loss of sweating is not found or is confined to the medial aspect of the forehead and side of the nose (Morris et al). Retraction of the eyeball (enophthalmos), considered a component of the syndrome, is probably an illusion created by narrowing of the palpebral fissure.

A localized lesion in a nerve causes degeneration of the distal portion of that fiber and loss of transmitter contents from the degenerated nerve ending\u2014without affecting neurons innervated by the fiber. Therefore, a preganglionic lesion leaves the postganglionic adrenergic neuron intact, whereas a postganglionic lesion results in degeneration of the adrenergic nerve endings and loss of stored catechol-amines from them.

Cluster headache is associated with ipsilateral symptoms of cranial parasympathetic autonomic activation: conjunctival injection or lacrimation, rhinorrhea or nasal congestion, or cranial sympathetic dysfunction such as ptosis.

Two subcortical systems modulate the activity of all movement; these are the basal ganglia (striatum, pallidum, and related structures, including the substantia nigra and subthalamic nucleus) and the cerebellum. Each of these systems plays an important role in the control of muscle tone, posture, and coordination. These structures and their disorders are the subjects of the following four chapters.

They produce a variable clinical picture depending on their location in the medulla, pons, or midbrain. Most often, this tumor begins in childhood (peak age of onset is 7 years), and 80 percent appear before the 21st year.

Alternative possibilities are that the lesion in the ventromedial tegmentum interrupts the brachium conjunctivum, a tegmental-thalamic projection, or the descending limb of the superior cerebellar peduncle, which functions as a link in a dentatoreticular-cerebellar feedback mechanism (see Fig. 5-3). The differential effect of drugs on tremor and bradykinesia suggest that they must have separate mechanisms. Intention (Ataxic, Cerebellar, Goal-Directed Action) Tremor As will be discussed in Chap. 5, the word intention is ambiguous in this context because the tremor itself is not intentional and occurs not when the patient intends to make a movement but only during the most demanding phases of active performance.

The responsible lesion probably lies in the tegmentum of the midbrain and involves the dentatorubrothalamic tracts and adjacent structures.

Instead, they are directly absorbed and enter the portal venous circula-tion rather than the lymphatics.

The relative paucity of lactase means that digestion of lactose, rather than uptake of the resulting products, is rate limiting for assimilation.

The small intestine serves most of the nutrient absorptive function of the gut. The intestinal mucosa exhibits villus architecture to provide maximal surface area for absorption and is endowed with specialized enzymes and transporters. Triturated food from the stomach mixes with pancreatic juice and bile in the duodenum to facilitate digestion. Pancreatic juice contains the main enzymes for carbohydrate, protein, and fat digestion as well as bicarbonate to optimize the pH for activation of these enzymes.

The vitamin is initially bound by saliva-derived R protein. In the duodenum, R protein is hydrolyzed by pancreatic enzymes, allowing free cobalamin to bind to gastric parietal cell-derived intrinsic factor. The cobalamin-intrinsic factor complex can escape hydrolysis by pancreatic enzymes, allowing it to reach the terminal ileum, which expresses specific receptors for intrin-sic factor. Subsequent events in cobalamin absorption are poorly characterized, but the intact complex probably enters enterocytes through translocation. Because each of these steps is necessary for cobalamin assimilation, gastric resection, gastric bypass, and ileal resection can each result in vitamin B12 insufficiency.Other water-soluble vitamins for which specific carrier-mediated transport processes have been characterized include ascorbic acid, folate, thiamine, riboflavin, pantothenic acid, and biotin.

Carbohydrates in the diet are present in the form of starch, disaccharides (sucrose and lactose), and glucose. Carbohydrates are absorbed only in the small intestine and only in the form of monosaccharides. Therefore, before their absorption, starch and disaccharides must first be digested by pancreatic amylase and intestinal brush border disaccharidases to monosaccharides. Monosaccharide absorption occurs by a Na-dependent process", "to achieve optimal use by the body. Route of Intake The RDAs apply only to oral intakes. When nutrients are administered parenterally, similar values can sometimes be used for amino acids, glucose (carbohydrate), fats, sodium, chloride, potassium, and most vitamins because their intestinal absorption rate is nearly 100%. However, the oral bioavailability of most mineral elements may be only half that obtained by parenteral administration. For some nutrients that are not readily stored in the body or that cannot be stored in large amounts, timing of administration may also be important. For example, amino acids cannot be used for protein synthesis if they are not supplied together; instead, they will be used for energy production, although in healthy individuals eating adequate diets, the distribution of protein intake over", "diets that are consistently limited in variety, especially with the exclusion of entire food groups, malabsorption syndromes, and conditions causing high physiologic requirements.

Adequate fluoroscopic examination requires that the patient be conscious and cooperative. The study incorporates recordings of swallow sequences during ingestion of food and liquids of varying consistencies. The pharynx is examined to detect bolus retention, regurgitation into the nose, or aspiration into the trachea.

Thus under normal circumstances, the epiglottis and arytenoid cartilage function to prevent aspiration of food and liquid into the lower respiratory tract. The act of swallowing food after mastication (chewing) usually occurs within 2 seconds, and it is closely synchronized with muscle reflexes that coordinate opening and closing of the airway. Hence, air is allowed to enter the lower airways, and food and liquids are kept out. Patients with some", "reflex can be elicited by stimulation of mechanical receptors in the nasopharynx and pharynx. This is a strong, short-duration inspiratory effort that brings material from the nasopharynx to the pharynx, where it can be swallowed or expectorated. The mechanical receptors responsible for the sniff reflex are also important in swallowing by inhibiting respiration and causing laryngeal closure. For anatomical reasons, only newborns can breathe and swallow simultaneously, which allows more rapid ingestion of nutrients. The larynx contains both superficial and deep receptors. Activation of the superficial receptors results in apnea, cough, and expiratory movements that protect the lower respiratory tract from aspirating foreign material. The deep receptors are located in the skeletal muscles of the larynx, and they control muscle fiber activation, as in other skeletal muscles.

Secondary afferents carry sensory impulses to certain brainstem nuclei, particularly the nucleus tractus solitarius, as described later, and the thalamus via the lateral spinothalamic and polysynaptic pathways.

These pathways mediate reflex actions called reflex arcs. In humans, most sensory neurons do not pass directly into the brain but instead communicate by specialized terminals (synapses) with motor neurons in the spinal cord. Functionally, the nervous system is divided into the following: \u0081 The somatic nervous system (SNS) consists of somatic [Gr. soma, body] parts of the CNS and PNS.

The myelin of these centrally located fibers is constituted differently from that of the peripheral nerves, being enveloped by oligodendrocytes rather than Schwann cells and the nerve fibers are supported by astrocytes rather than fibroblasts.

Through the production of hypothalamic releasing factors, the central nervous system (CNS) exerts a major regulatory influence over pituitary hormone secretion (Chap. 401e). The peripheral nervous system stimulates the adrenal medulla. The immune and endocrine systems are also intimately intertwined. The adrenal hormone cortisol is a powerful immunosuppressant.

Cultures of selected anatomic sites (blood, sputum, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and stool) and nonculture methods (antigen testing, polymerase chain reaction, and serology) also may confirm specific etiologic agents. C. Formulate a Microbiologic Diagnosis The history, physical examination, and immediately available laboratory results (eg, Gram stain of urine or sputum) may provide highly specific information. For example, in a young man with urethritis and a Gram-stained smear from the urethral meatus demonstrating intracellular Gram-negative diplococci, the most likely pathogen is Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In the latter instance, however, the clinician should be aware that a significant number of patients with gonococcal", "the urethral meatus demonstrating intracellular Gram-negative diplococci, the most likely pathogen is Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In the latter instance, however, the clinician should be aware that a significant number of patients with gonococcal urethritis have negative Gram stains for the organism and that a significant number of patients with gonococcal urethritis harbor concurrent chlamydial infection that is not demonstrated on the Gram-stained smear. D. Determine the Necessity for Empiric Therapy Whether to initiate empiric therapy is an important clinical decision based partly on experience and partly on data from clinical trials. Empiric therapy is indicated when there is a significant risk of serious morbidity or mortality if therapy is withheld until a specific pathogen is detected by the clinical laboratory. In other settings, empiric therapy may be indicated for", "at the time of collection rather than first being transported to the laboratory (e.g., urethral swabs being cultured for Neisseria gonorrhoeae). In general, the more rapidly a specimen is plated onto appropriate media, the better the chance is for isolating bacterial pathogens. Deep tissue or fluid (pus) samples are more likely to give useful culture results than are superficial swab specimens. Table 150e-2 lists procedures for collection and transport of common specimens. Because there are many pathogen-specific paradigms for these procedures, it is important to seek advice from the microbiology laboratory when in doubt about a particular situation. Isolation of pathogens from clinical material relies on the use of artificial media that support bacterial growth. Such media are composed of agar, nutrients, and sometimes substances that inhibit the", "the posterior urethra and causes incontinence or difficulty with urination. Diagnosis \u2022 detection metHods Historically, chlamydiae were cultivated in the yolk sac of embryonated eggs. The organisms can be grown more easily in tissue culture, but cell culture\u2014once considered the diagnostic gold standard\u2014has been replaced by nonculture assays (Table 213-1). In general, culture for chlamydiae in clinical specimens is now performed only in specialized laboratories. The first nonculture assays, such as DFA staining of clinical material and enzyme immunoassay (EIA), have been replaced by NAATS, which are molecular Infection Suggestive Signs/Symptoms Presumptive Diagnosisa Confirmatory Test of Choice aA presumptive diagnosis of chlamydial infection is often made in the syndromes listed when gonococci are not found.

Cultures should be obtained from the pharynx and anus of both girls and boys, the urethra of boys, and the vagina of girls; cervical specimens are not recommended for prepubertal girls. For boys with a urethral discharge, a meatal specimen of the discharge is adequate for culture. Presumptive colonies of N. gonorrhoeae should be identified definitively by at least two independent methods. Blood should be cultured in suspected cases of DGI.

Several amplification tests are now available on semiautomated or fully automated platforms. Because of the legal implications, the preferred method for the diagnosis of gonococcal infection in children is a standardized culture. Two positive NAATs, each targeting a different nucleic acid sequence, may be substituted for culture of the cervix or the urethra as legal evidence of infection in children. Although nonculture tests for gonococcal infection have not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use with specimens obtained from the pharynx and rectum of infected children, NAATs from these sites are preferred for diagnostic evaluation in adult victims of suspected sexual abuse, especially", "reactive arthritis. Although digital examination of the prostate gland seldom contributes to the evaluation of sexually active young men with urethritis, men with dysuria who lack evidence of urethritis as well as sexually inactive men with urethritis should undergo prostate palpation, urinalysis, and urine culture to exclude bacterial prostatitis and cystitis. 3. Evaluate for gonococcal and chlamydial infection. An absence of typical gram-negative diplococci on Gram\u2019s-stained smear of urethral exudate containing inflammatory cells warrants a preliminary diagnosis of NGU, as this test is 98% sensitive for the diagnosis of gonococcal urethral infection. However, an increasing proportion of men with symptoms and/or signs of urethritis are simultaneously assessed for infection with N. gonorrhoeae and C. trachomatis by \u201cmultiplex\u201d NAATs of first-voided urine. The urine specimen tested should consist of", "gram-negative intracellular diplococci as well. Alternatively, the centrifuged sediment of the first 20\u201330 mL of voided urine\u2014ideally collected as the first morning specimen\u2014 can be examined for inflammatory cells, either by microscopy showing \u226510 leukocytes per high-power field or by the leukocyte esterase test. Patients with symptoms who lack objective evidence of urethritis may have functional rather than organic problems and generally do not benefit from repeated courses of antibiotics. 2.

A brief history 871 and examination will exclude epididymitis and systemic complications, such as disseminated gonococcal infection (DGI) and reactive arthritis.

For this reason, most laboratories test for antibody directed at both viral capsid antigens and antigens associated with recently infected host cells to determine the stage of infection. To culture bacterial, fungal, or viral pathogens, an appropriate sample must be placed into the proper medium for growth. The success of efforts to identify a specific pathogen often depends on the collection and transport process coupled to a laboratory-processing algorithm suitable for the specific sample/agent.
