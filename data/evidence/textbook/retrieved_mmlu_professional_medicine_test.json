Hendricks (1968) observed that \"the clinician makes great demands upon the uterus.\" The uterus is expected to remain well relaxed during pregnancy, to contract efectively but intermittently during labor, and then to remain in a state of almost constant contraction for several hours postpartum. Figure 24-28 demonstrates an example of normal uterine activity during labor. Uterine activity progressively and gradually rises from early through late labor. Interestingly, uterine contractions after birth are identical to those resulting in delivery of the newborn. Logically, the uterus that performs poorly before delivery is also prone to atony and puerperal hemorrhage. J.A. 5-26-60", "Hicks contractions that prompt an incorrect diagnosis of false labor. Accordingly, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2016b) defines preterm labor to be regular contractions before 37 weeks that are associated with cervical change. In addition to contractions, pelvic pressure, menstrual-like cramps, watery vaginal discharge, and lower back pain have been empirically associated with impending preterm birth. Such complaints are thought by some to be common in normal pregnancy and are therefore often minimized by patients and obstetrical care providers. he importance of these symptoms as a harbinger of labor has been emphasized by some but not all investigators (lams, 1990; Kragt, 1990). lams and coworkers (1994) found that the signs and symptoms signaling preterm labor, including uterine contractions, appeared only within 24 hours of preterm labor.", "seldom greater than 20 mm Hg, and these have been equated with those irst described by John Braxton Hicks. Uterine activity increases gradually after 30 weeks, and it is noteworthy that these Braxton Hicks contractions also increase in intensity and frequency.

These results suggest that normal human labor is relatively short. \u2022 Summary of Normal Labor Labor is characterized by brevity and considerable biological variation. Active labor can be reliably diagnosed when cervical dilation is :3 cm in the presence of uterine contractions. Once this cervical dilation threshold is reached, normal progression to delivery can be expected, depending on parity, in the ensuing 4 to 6 hours. Anticipated progress during a 1-to 3-hour second stage is monitored to ensure fetal safety. Finally, most women in spontaneous labor, regardless of parity, if left unaided, will deliver within approximately 10 hours after admission for spontaneous labor.

False labor often stops spontaneously, or it may proceed rapidly into efective contractions. A second method deines the onset of labor as beginning at the time of admission to the labor unit. In the United States, admission for labor is frequently based on the extent of cervical dilation accompanied by painful contractions. If a woman has intact membranes, then a cervical dilation of3 to 4 cm or greater is presumed to be a reasonably reliable threshold for the diagnosis of labor. In this case, labor onset commences with the time of admission. his presumptive method obviates many of the uncertainties", "uterine dyunction, either basal tone is elevated appreciably or the pressure gradient is distorted. Gradient distortion may result from more forceful contraction of the uterine midsegment than the fundus, from complete asynchrony of the impulses originating in each cornu, or from a combination of these two. hese just-described types of uterine dysfunction can in turn lead to labor abnormalities (Table 23-2). First, the latent phase may be prolonged, which is defined as exceeding 20 hours in the nullipara and 14 hours in the multipara. In some, uterine contractions cease, suggesting false labor. In the remainder, an abnormally long latent phase persists and is often treated with oxytocin stimulation. In active labor, disorders are divided into slower-than-normal progress-a protraction disorder-or complete cessation of progress-an arrest disorder.

Two of its components-amniotomy and oxytocinhave been widely used, especially in English-speaking countries outside the United States. With this protocol, labor is diagnosed when painful contractions are accompanied by complete cervical efacement, bloody \"show,\" or ruptured membranes. Women with such indings are committed to delivery within 12 hours. Pelvic examination is performed each hour for the next 3 hours, and thereafter at 2-hour intervals. When dilation has not increased by at least 1 cm/hr, amniotomy is performed.

This does not easily aid the clinician in determining when labor has actually begun, because this diagnosis is conirmed only retrospectively. Several methods may be used to mark its start.

Alternatively, the patient is asked to produce a maximal contraction and the examiner estimates power by the force needed to overcome or \u201cbreak\u201d it (isometric contraction or maximum voluntary isometric contraction).

If the tests come back normal, the hypothesis may have to be discarded or substantially modified.

The fatty acids in the blood, derived mainly from adipose tissue and intracellular lipid stores, constitute the other major source of energy. Carbohydrate is metabolized during aerobic and anaerobic phases of metabolism; the fatty acids are metabolized only aerobically. Resting muscle derives approximately 70 percent of its energy from the oxidation of long-chain fatty acids. As stated earlier, the circumstances during exercise are somewhat different. During a short period of intense exercise, the muscle uses carbohydrate derived from glycogen stores; myophosphorylase is the enzyme that initiates the metabolism of glycogen. With longer aerobic exercise, blood flow to muscle and the availability of glucose and fatty acids are increased. At first, glucose is the main source of energy during exercise; later, with exhaustion of glycogen", "is reduced. The resulting hyperglycemia can be corrected, however, with the use of exogenous insulin, and when normoglycemia is achieved in the perioperative period, the main components of metabolism also normalize.51The preoperative and postoperative fasting state triggers insulin resistance resulting in a catabolic state with gluconeo-genesis and protein breakdown. Following prolonged fasting states with stress such as following surgery, protein catabolism can be increased several fold over baseline. As less glycogen is stored in the muscle and loss of lean body mass occurs, there is less muscle function and therefore less capacity to mobilize.In addition to the typical metabolic effects of surgery, pain has been demonstrated to increase insulin resistance.

The association of obesity with type 2 diabetes has been recognized for decades, with visceral obesity being common in a majority of affected patients. Insulin resistance is present even with simple obesity unaccompanied by hyperglycemia, indicating a fundamental abnormality of insulin signaling in states of fat excess.

Even the brain can use ketone bodies to help meet its energy needs if the blood levels rise sufficiently. Thus, ketone bodies spare glucose, which is particularly important during prolonged periods of fasting (see p. 332).

A.", "the absence of insulin. In uncontrolled type 1 diabetes, an excess of counter-regulatory hormones (cortisol, catecholamines, and glucagon) contributes to further metabolic dysfunction. In the absence of adequate amounts of insulin, increasing breakdown products of muscle (amino acid proteolysis), fat (fatty acid lipolysis), and glycogen (glucose glycogenolysis) are recognized. There is an increase in glucose production from noncarbohydrate precursors as a result of gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis in the liver. Without prompt treatment, severe metabolic decompensation (i.e., diabetic ketoacidosis) will occur and may lead to death.

A threeto fourfold rise of lactic acid is typical. The simultaneous measurement of ammonia serves as a control, because it should also rise with exercise. In patients with myophosphorylase deficiency or other glycolytic defects, the lactic acid rise will be absent or below normal, while the rise in ammonia will reach control values. If there is lack of effort, neither lactic acid nor ammonia will rise. Patients with selective failure to increase ammonia may have myoadenylate deaminase deficiency.

Repeat treatment may be needed and effectiveness may be increased by concurrent administration of low-dose recombinant TSH (0.1 mg IM). It is possible to achieve a 40\u201350% reduction in goiter size in most patients. Earlier concerns about radiation-induced thyroid swelling and tracheal compression have diminished, as studies have shown this complication to be rare. When acute compression occurs, glucocorticoid treatment or surgery may be needed. Radiation-induced hypothyroidism is less common than after treatment for Graves\u2019 disease. However, posttreatment autoimmune thyrotoxicosis may occur in up to 5% of patients treated for nontoxic MNG. Surgery remains highly effective but is not without risk, particularly in older", "Recurrent thyrotoxicosis usually is managed by radioiodine treatment.Toxic Multinodular Goiter Toxic multinodular goiters usu-ally occur in older individuals, who often have a prior history of a nontoxic multinodular goiter. Over several years, enough thyroid nodules become autonomous to cause hyperthyroidism. The presentation often is insidious in that hyperthyroidism may only become apparent when patients are placed on low doses of thyroid hormone suppression for the goiter. Some patients have T3 toxicosis, whereas others may present only with atrial fibrillation or congestive heart failure. Hyperthyroidism also can be precipitated by iodide-containing drugs such as contrast media and the antiarrhythmic agent amiodarone (Jod-Basedow 1Brunicardi_Ch38_p1625-p1704.indd 163701/03/19 11:20 AM 1638SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONSPART IIhyperthyroidism).

Blood tests are similar", "TSH suppression in iodine-replete populations. Thyroidectomy should be performed if a nodule enlarges on TSH suppression, causes compressive symptoms, or for cos-metic reasons. An exception to this general rule is the patient who has had previous irradiation of the thyroid gland or has a family history of thyroid cancer. In these patients, total or near-total thyroidectomy is recommended because of the high incidence of thyroid cancer and decreased reliability of FNAB in this setting.Malignant Thyroid DiseaseIn the United States, thyroid cancer accounts for <1% of all malignancies (2% of women and 0.5% of men) and is the most rapidly increasing cancer in women. Thyroid cancer is respon-sible for six deaths per million persons annually. Most patients present with a palpable swelling in the neck, which initiates assessment through", "for severe cases.

Hyperfunctioning nodules present with hyperthyroidism and local symptoms (dysphagia, dyspnea, cough, choking sensation) and are associated with a family history (especially medullary thyroid cancer). An \u2191 risk of malignancy is associated with a history of neck irradiation, \u201ccold\u201d nodules on radionuclide scan, male sex, age < 20 or > 70, firm and fixed solitary nodules, a family history (especially medullary thyroid cancer), and rapidly growing nodules with hoarseness.

Suppression of TSH is not seen and not necessary in all cases because such suppression may lead to excessive doses of levothyroxine. The etiology of acquired hypothyroidism is presented in Table 175-2. The clinical manifestations may be subtle. Hypothyroidism should be suspected in any child who has a decline in growth velocity, especially if not associated with weight loss (see Table 175-3). The most common cause of acquired hypothyroidism in older children in the United States is lymphocytic autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto thyroiditis). In many areas of the world, iodine deficiency is the etiology of endemic goiter (endemic cretinism). The failure of the thyroid gland may be heralded", "For unclear reasons the incidence of papillary cancer increased by almost threefold in the past 30 years, from 2.7 to 7.7 per 100,000 people (55). This may represent the more ready diagnosis of smaller cancers. The majority of cancers are found incidentally during routine examinations. Risk factors include a history of radiation exposure during childhood and family history. Signs include rapid growth of neck mass, new onset hoarseness, or vocal cord paralysis. In the setting of rapid growth, fixed nodule, new onset hoarseness, or the presence of lymphadenopathy, it is important to be sure a fine-needle aspiration is done. Thyroidectomy is the primary treatment with radioactive iodine and TSH suppression with thyroxine. Patients younger than 50 years of age with a primary tumor of less than 4 cm", "(394). Postablative hypothyroidism develops in 50% of patients within the first year after iodine therapy and in more than 2% of patients per year thereafter. A higher rate of miscarriage was noted in women treated with iodine therapy in the year preceding therapy, but there is no reported increase in the rate of stillbirths, preterm birth, low birth weight, congenital malformation, or death after therapy (396). Many thyroidologists and nuclear medicine specialists are willing to allow pregnancy earlier than 1 year after therapy if patients receive replacement therapy with levothyroxine.

Studies suggest that the combination", "preoperative scanning, it also has reduced accuracy in the presence of multiglandular disease.Endoscopic approaches include both video-assisted and total endoscopic techniques. Total endoscopic parathyroidec-tomy was first described by Gagner in 1996,86 and several other investigators have since reported on this technique. Although port placements are variable, as is the case with endoscopic thy-roidectomy, they all involve creation of a working space in the neck using CO2 insufflation, with the reported advantages being superior cosmesis and excellent visualization. Although feasi-ble, these techniques also have been associated with increased operating times, more personnel, and greater expense, and have, in general, not been useful for patients with multiglandu-lar disease, a large thyroid mass, or previous neck surgery and irradiation.

In these situations, thiazides are also effective but should be used as adjunctive therapy with other measures. Hypercalcemia can be a medical emergency (see Chapter 42). Because loop diuretics reduce Ca2+ reabsorption significantly, they can be quite effective in promoting Ca2+ diuresis. However, loop diuretics alone can cause marked volume contraction.

When available, the calculated supersaturation is also informative. There is substantial day-to-day variability in the 24-h excretion of many relevant factors; therefore, obtaining values from two collections is important before committing a patient to long-term lifestyle changes or medication. The interpretation of the 24-h urine results should take into account that the collections are usually performed on a weekend day when the patient is staying at home; an individual\u2019s habits may differ dramatically (beneficially or detrimentally) at work or outside the home.

The combined use of these therapies can increase urinary calcium excretion to \u226512.5 mmol/d (500 mg/d) in most hypercalcemic patients.

Precautions should be taken to prevent potassium and magnesium depletion; calcium-containing renal calculi are a potential complication. Under life-threatening circumstances, the preceding approach can be pursued more aggressively, but the availability of effective agents to block bone resorption (such as bisphosphonates) has reduced the need for extreme diuresis regimens (Table 424-4). Depletion of potassium and magnesium is inevitable unless replacements are given; pulmonary edema can be precipitated.

Approximately two thirds of kidney stones contain Ca2+ phosphate or Ca2+ oxalate. Although there are numerous medical conditions (hyperparathyroidism, hypervitaminosis D, sarcoidosis, malignancies, etc) that cause hypercalciuria, many patients with such stones exhibit a defect in proximal tubular Ca2+ reabsorption. This can be treated with thiazide diuretics, which enhance Ca2+ reabsorption in the DCT and thus reduce the urinary Ca2+ concentration. Fluid intake should be increased, but salt intake must be reduced, since excess dietary NaCl will overwhelm the hypocalciuric effect of thiazides. Dietary Ca2+ should not be restricted, as this can lead to negative total body Ca2+ balance. Calcium stones", "(NCC). In contrast to the situation in the TAL, in which loop diuretics inhibit Ca2+ reabsorption, thiazides actually enhance Ca2+ reabsorption. This enhancement has been postulated to result from effects in both the proximal and distal convoluted tubules. In the proximal tubule, thiazide-induced volume depletion leads to enhanced Na+ and passive Ca2+ reabsorption. In the DCT, lowering of intracellular Na+ by thiazide-induced blockade of Na+ entry enhances Na+/Ca2+ exchange in the basolateral membrane (Figure 15\u20134) and increases overall reabsorption of Ca2+. Although thiazides rarely cause hypercalcemia as a result of this enhanced reabsorption, they can unmask hypercalcemia due to other causes (eg, primary hyperparathyroidism, carcinoma, sarcoidosis). Thiazides are sometimes useful in the prevention of calcium-containing kidney stones caused by hypercalciuria. They may also modestly reduce the risk of", "calcium in the urine. Therefore, the initial infusion of 500\u20131000 mL/h of saline to reverse the dehydration and restore urine flow can by itself substantially lower serum calcium. The addition of a loop diuretic such as furosemide following rehydration enhances urine flow and also inhibits calcium reabsorption in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle (see Chapter 15). Monitoring of central venous pressure is important to forestall the development of heart failure and pulmonary edema in predisposed subjects. In many subjects, saline diuresis suffices to reduce serum calcium to a point at which more definitive diagnosis and treatment of the underlying condition can be achieved. If this is not the case or if more prolonged medical treatment of hypercalcemia is required, the following agents are available (discussed", "or multiple and may be palpable. Patients with parathyroid cancer or familial HPT are more likely to present with hypercalcemic crisis.Treatment consists of therapies to lower serum calcium levels followed by surgery to correct HPT. The mainstay of therapy involves rehydration with a 0.9% saline solution to keep urine output >100 cc/h. Once urine output is established, diure-sis with furosemide (which increases renal calcium clearance) is begun. If these methods are unsuccessful, other drugs may be used to lower serum calcium levels as outlined in Table 38-13. Occasionally, in life-threatening cases, hemodialysis may be of benefit.Secondary Hyperparathyroidism.

The risks of intravenous phosphate therapy include sudden hypocalcemia, ectopic calcification, acute renal failure, and hypotension.

Spot or 24-hour urine studies for mineral and electrolyte determinations, obtained on a typical diet for the child, are important to characterize any underlying metabolic predisposition and are valuable even when a stone is available for analysis.

Cough that resolves promptly and is clearly associated with a viral infection does not require further diagnostic workup. However, cough persisting longer than 3 weeks warrants further evaluation. Chest radiographs are useful in assessing respiratory disease in children. In addition to determining lung abnormalities, they provide information about the bony thorax (rib or vertebral abnormalities), the heart (cardiomegaly, pericardial effusion), and the great vessels (right aortic arch/vascular rings, rib notching).

The natural history of the disease in older women must be balanced against life expectancy as a function of overall health (42). For high-risk women, consideration can be given to earlier initiation of screening (5 to 10 years earlier than the age of the index case) and shorter intervals between screening, and the use of additional imaging modalities such as breast ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with dedicated breast coils.

The elevated prolactin levels distinguish this disorder from idiopathic galactorrhea, in which the serum prolactin concentration is normal.

A 1979 National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference recommended advising pregnant women who were 35 years and older about the possibility of amniocentesis for fetal karyotyping. he threshold was based on the greater risk for selected fetal chromosomal abnormalities with increasing maternal age and on the assumption that at that time, the loss rate attributable to amniocentesis was equivalent to the fetal Down syndrome risk at maternal age 35.

Figure 24-28 demonstrates an example of normal uterine activity during labor. Uterine activity progressively and gradually rises from early through late labor.

If, at peak exercise, the patient achieves predicted maximal ventilation, demonstrates an increase in dead space or hypoxemia, or develops bronchospasm, the respiratory system is probably the cause of the problem.

This phenomenon has been attributed, on uncertain grounds, to isolation of the brainstem respiratory centers from the cerebrum, rendering them more sensitive than usual to carbon dioxide (hyperventilation drive). It is postulated that as a result of overbreathing, the blood carbon dioxide drops below the concentration required to stimulate the centers, and breathing gradually stops. Carbon dioxide then reaccumulates until it exceeds the respiratory threshold, and the cycle then repeats itself. Alternatively, the periodicity has been attributed to the stimulating effect of a low arterial PO2 on a depressed respiratory center.

Apart from these patterns that suggest certain possibilities of disease and exclude others, diagnosis depends on the age of the patient at the time of onset and tempo of progression, the coexistence of medical disorders, certain laboratory findings (serum concentrations of muscle enzymes, EMG, and biopsy findings), and genetic determinants. The symptoms and signs of muscle disease are considered in this chapter mainly in connection with the age of the patient at the time of onset, their mode of evolution, and the presence or absence of familial occurrence. Because many muscle diseases are hereditary, a careful family history is important. The pattern of inheritance has diagnostic significance and, if genetic counseling or prenatal diagnosis is a consideration, a detailed genealogic tree becomes essential.

The EMG shows fibrillations, positive waves, low-amplitude and brief polyphasic motor unit potentials, and, sometimes, high-frequency discharges. The female carrier may occasionally display the same abnormalities, but to a much milder degree. The molecular and genetic bases of the disease are discussed further on. This milder dystrophy is closely related to the Duchenne type clinically, genetically, and ultrastructurally, involving the same DMD gene as in the Duchenne type. It had long been noted that mixed with the Duchenne group were relatively benign cases. In 1955, Becker and Keiner proposed that the latter be separated as a distinct entity, now called Becker", "of cardiac decompensation. Patients with Duchenne dystrophy usually survive until late adolescence, but not more than 20 to 25 percent live beyond the twenty-fifth year.

The average IQ is 85 and approximately one-quarter have an IQ below 70, but the range has been 40 to 130. As mentioned earlier, female carriers of the disease (i.e., the mothers of affected boys) and described slight weakness and enlargement of the calves as well as elevated CK values and abnormalities of the electromyelogram (EMG) and muscle biopsy, all slight in degree, in more than half; as mentioned, this is far higher", "5 and 15 years, although onset in the third or fourth decade or even later can occur. By definition, patients with Becker dystrophy walk beyond age 15, whereas patients with Duchenne dystrophy are typically in a wheelchair by the age of 12. Patients with Becker dystrophy have a reduced life expectancy, but most survive into the fourth or fifth decade. Mental retardation may occur in Becker dystrophy, but it is not as common as in Duchenne. Cardiac involvement occurs in Becker dystrophy and may result in heart failure; some patients manifest with only heart failure. Other less common presentations are asymptomatic hyper-CK-emia, myalgias without weakness, and myoglobinuria.

In most individuals, the disease course is slow or nonprogressive, although many children with CMD are wheelchair dependent and require some type of respiratory support. Contractures and scoliosis are often progressive and severely worsen; respiratory status diminishes with age. Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD), also known as humeroperoneal muscular dystrophy, can be inherited as an X-linked recessive, autosomal dominant, or autosomal recessive disorder. Symptoms typically begin in childhood, although adult onset has been noted. Patients may experience early contractures, slowly progressive humeroperoneal muscle weakness or wasting, and cardiac disease with conduction defects and arrhythmias. EDMD is associated with mild elevations of serum CK levels, abnormal electrocardiograms (ECG), characteristic changes on muscle imaging, and abnormal but nonspecific muscle", "50% of DM patients have mental retardation. In addition, children with congenital DM experience a second progressive phase of the disease in the teen years, including potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias. Diagnosis is established by genetic testing. Other Forms of Childhood Muscle Disease Congenital muscular dystrophies (CMDs) refer to a group of genetically determined conditions that present in infancy or early childhood. The most common subtypes include merosin-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy, Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy, and the dystroglycanopathies. The characteristic clinical features include hypotonia, extremity weakness, delayed motor development, and congenital contractures. Diagnosis is established through the combination of elevated serum CK and dystrophic changes detected on muscle biopsy. In most individuals, the disease course is slow or nonprogressive, although many children with CMD are wheelchair dependent and require", "girdle dystrophy. Clinically they resemble severe Duchenne dystrophy in practically all respects, including the presence of calf hypertrophy, cardiomyopathy, and marked elevation of CK in the early stages of the illness. The obvious distinction from Duchenne dystrophy is the autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance (affection of both girls and boys in the same sibship). The largest and best-studied group of this severe, recessive pelvic-pectoral dystrophy (99 children in 28 families) has come from Tunisia (Ben Hamida et al). It also occurs commonly in other Arab countries and has been observed repeatedly in Brazil, but less so in Europe and North America. The basic defect is in 1 of 4 dystrophin-associated glycoproteins (DAGs)\u2014a-, b-, g-, and d-sarcoglycan (see Fig. 45-2); a-sarcoglycan (designated 50 DAG) is also called adhalin, from", "on different chromosomes and analysis of DNA from the patient\u2019s leukocytes can be used for genetic diagnosis.

Clinical variations of these disorders, particularly in severity and age of onset, are well known. Some patients, with no previous symptoms of cramps or myoglobinuria, develop progressive weakness of limb muscles in the sixth or seventh decade. One of these older patients came to our attention because of chronically elevated levels of CK and mild muscle cramping after climbing stairs. In others, rapidly progressive weakness became evident in infancy, with early death from respiratory failure.

With slowly evolving processes involving the upper cord, such as multiple sclerosis, the bladder spasticity and urgency worsen with time and incontinence becomes more frequent. In addition, initiation of voluntary micturition is impaired and bladder capacity is reduced. Bladder sensation depends on the extent of involvement of sensory tracts. Bulbocavernosus and anal reflexes are preserved. The cystometrogram shows uninhibited contractions of the detrusor muscle in response to small volumes of fluid.

The pudendal nerve terminal motor latency (PNTML) indirectly assesses the integrity and patency of the terminal portion of the pudendal nerve, its neuromuscular junction, and the muscle it serves. Using a specialized electrode affixed over the index finger, the pudendal nerve is electrically stimulated near the ischial spine (either transrectally or transvaginally), and the resulting muscular response is measured. The response, termed a compound muscle action", "differentiate between the normal urge experienced when the bladder is full from the abnormal response that may require treatment. This is a symptom-based diagnosis; the cause may or may not be detrusor overactivity, based on urodynamic observation characterized by involuntary detrusor contractions during the filling phase. Women may have other related problems such as urgency, nocturia, and increased daytime frequency. The definition of nocturia is quantifiable: The woman wakes one or more times a night to void (8). Increased daytime frequency occurs when the patient considers that she voids too often. The term pollakisuria is used to describe this condition in many countries. Urgency is the sudden compelling desire to pass urine that is difficult to defer. Most women have experienced these symptoms during times of voluntary delays", "the same as normal voiding. Some women may empty their bladders completely but only by expending great effort over several minutes. In such cases, voiding is clearly abnormal, even though the bladder is empty when voiding ceases. In the worst cases, voiding is both difficult and incomplete. Causes Neurologic diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, may cause voiding difficulty as a result of detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia, in which the urethral sphincter contracts at the same time as the detrusor (143). Great effort is required to overcome urethral resistance; the patient voids with an interrupted stop-and-start stream and usually has a significant amount of residual urine. Other causes of voiding difficulty include medications (such as antihistamines and anticholinergic agents), infections (in particular, herpes simplex virus, and urinary tract infections), obstruction (following", "present; plantar reflexes are sometimes extensor.

Surprisingly, little has been written about this condition despite its frequency in clinical practice. It is seen most often following subarachnoid hemorrhage from a ruptured aneurysm, less often with bleeding from an arteriovenous malformation or from deep intracerebral hemorrhage that dissects into the ventricles. It may also occur as the result of obstruction of the CSF pathways in the fourth ventricle by a tumor or cerebellar\u2013brainstem hemorrhage, or within the basal cisterns by neoplastic infiltration of the meninges, although this last process tends to evolve more subacutely.

Neurophysiologic Tests The neuromuscular function of the pelvic \ufb02oor is dependent on the integrity of the nervous system. Injury can theoretically occur anywhere along these nerves, from the cell body located in Onuf\u2019s nucleus in the ventral part of the spinal cord, along its axon, to the neuromuscular junction. Pelvic \ufb02oor neurophysiology utilizes techniques applied to nerves and skeletal muscles elsewhere in the body to document neuromuscular integrity or evidence of injury. These tests are not routinely used in the clinical evaluation of most incontinent women. Figure 26.8 Voiding cystometrogram. This patient voids", "antibacterial treatment is generally unnecessary. If hematuria and bacteriuria are found, the urine should be rechecked after eradication of the bacteriuria. Hematuria found in the absence of bacteriuria may need further evaluation to rule out kidney or bladder tumors; the necessity for and extent of the evaluation depends on concomitant risk factors and the clinical presentation. If malignancy is suspected, bladder biopsy should be performed by the surgeon who would treat the patient in the event a malignancy is discovered. Routine urinary cytology is not helpful, but testing may be of value in women older than 50 years with irritative urinary tract symptoms, particularly if those symptoms are of sudden onset. Postvoid Residual Volume Incomplete bladder emptying may cause incontinence. Patients with a large postvoid residual (PVR) urine", "of sectioning the ninth cranial nerve and upper rootlets of the tenth, has proved to be effective in intractable cases. The same mechanism is probably operative in so-called deglutitional syncope, in which consciousness is lost during or immediately after a forceful swallow. The administration of anticholinergic drugs (propantheline 15 mg tid) has abolished these attacks (Levin and Posner). This infrequent condition is usually seen in men, sometimes in young adults but more often in the elderly, who arise from bed at night to urinate. The syncope occurs at the end of micturition or soon thereafter, and the loss of consciousness is abrupt, with rapid and complete recovery. Several factors are probably operative. A full bladder causes reflex vasoconstriction; as the bladder empties, this gives way to vasodilatation, which,", "culture. Many women treated repetitively for chronic cystitis take multiple courses of antibiotics on the basis of symptoms without ever having the presence of an infection confirmed by cultures. Detrusor overactivity may be the cause of frequency, urgency, and urge incontinence, but that is not usually a factor in dysuria or painful urination. Women older than 50 years (particularly those who smoke or are exposed to chemicals at work) are at risk for bladder cancer, and this possibility must be considered, especially if hematuria is present. Urinary cytologic assessment is sometimes helpful in detecting early tumors of the urinary tract, and cystoscopy and intravenous urography are mandatory in the evaluation of patients with hematuria.

The major features to be identified on palpation of the breast are temperature, texture and thickness of skin, generalized or focal tenderness, nodularity, density, asymmetry, dominant masses, and nipple discharge. Most premenopausal patients have normally nodular breast parenchyma. The nodularity is diffuse but predominantly in the upper outer quadrants, where there is more breast tissue. These benign parenchymal nodules are small, similar in size, and indistinct. By comparison, breast cancer usually occurs in the form of a nontender, firm mass with irregular margins. A cancerous mass feels distinctly different from the surrounding nodularity. A malignant mass may be fixed to the skin or to the underlying", "of a neoplastic process. Physical Examination Breast tumors, particularly cancerous ones, usually are asymptomatic and are discovered by the patient or through physical examination or screening mammography. Typically, the breast changes slightly during the menstrual cycle. During the premenstrual phase, most women have increased innocuous nodularity and mild engorgement of the breast. Rarely these characteristics can obscure an underlying lesion and make examination difficult. Findings should be carefully documented in the medical record to serve as a baseline for future reference. Inspection Inspection is performed initially while the patient is seated comfortably with her arms relaxed at her sides. The breasts are compared for symmetry, contour, and skin appearance. Edema or erythema is identified easily, and skin dimpling or nipple retraction is shown by having the patient raise", "breast cancer accounts for the greatest num-ber of malpractice claims for errors in diagnosis and for the largest number of paid claims. Litigation often involves younger women, whose physical examination and mammogram may be misleading.

They are often bilobed, and a groove can be palpated on examination. On mammographic and ultrasonographic imaging, the typical features are of a well-defined, smooth, solid mass with clearly defined margins and dimensions that are longer than wide and craniocaudad dimensions that are less than the length. Fibroadenoma is not associated with an increased risk for breast cancer (144). The natural history of fibroadenoma can be regression, growth, or no change in size.

Additional molecular analysis of these lesions may make it possible to discriminate between patients who are at risk of further progression and require additional therapy and those in whom simple follow-up is adequate. Breast cancer is about 1/150th as frequent in men as in women; 1720 men developed breast cancer in 2006. It usually presents as a unilateral lump in the breast and is frequently not diagnosed promptly. Given the small amount of soft tissue and the unexpected nature of the problem, locally advanced presentations are somewhat more common. When male breast cancer is matched to female breast cancer by age and stage, its overall prognosis is identical. Although gynecomastia may", "age 30 years appears to have a minimal carcinogenic effect on the breast. Because the breasts are a common site of potentially fatal malignancy in women, examination of the breast is an essential part of the physical examination. Unfortunately, internists frequently do not examine breasts in men, and in women, they are apt to defer this evaluation to gynecologists. Because of the plausible association between early detection and improved outcome, it is the duty of every physician to identify breast abnormalities at the earliest possible stage and to institute a diagnostic workup. Women should be trained in breast self-examination (BSE). Although breast cancer in men is unusual, unilateral lesions should be evaluated in the same manner as in women, with the recognition that gynecomastia in men can sometimes", "may increase the sensitivity of palpation, and the privacy of the shower may provide a less anxiety-provoking environment. It is helpful for all women to examine their breasts at the same time each month to develop a routine. Premenopausal women should examine their breasts monthly 7 to 10 days after the onset of the menstrual cycle. For postmenopausal women, selection of a specific calendar date is a helpful way to remember to perform a monthly BSE. Women should be instructed to report any abnormalities or changes to their physicians. If the physician cannot confirm the patient\u2019s findings, the examination should be repeated in 1 month or after her next menstrual period. Mammography Screen-film mammography was considered the best method for imaging the breast (15). Full-field digital mammography, which", "years, and after that age, every 2 to 3 years if the woman has a life expectancy of more than 4 years (36). The reasons for liberalization of the screening interval recommendations for older women include improved biology profile, slower growth rate, and lower risk for recurrence (37\u201341). The natural history of the disease in older women must be balanced against life expectancy as a function of overall health (42). For high-risk women, consideration can be given to earlier initiation of screening (5 to 10 years earlier than the age of the index case) and shorter intervals between screening, and the use of additional imaging modalities such as breast ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with dedicated breast coils. No screening test is perfect, and false-negative imaging studies", "of 40 and 49 (18). Because of these findings, it is recommended that all women undergo yearly screening mammography starting at age 40, along with clinical breast examination at least every 3 years (19). Monthly breast self-examination (BSE) is no longer recommended because there is little evidence to show that BSE is superior to heightened breast awareness such that any new symptoms related to the breast in daily activities would be reported promptly when noticed. BSE was not shown to improve survival. Women should be informed about the benefits and limitations of monthly BSE, mainly the risk of a false-positive result. Women who would still prefer to perform BSE should be instructed in the technique and occasionally have their technique reviewed.

Opportunistic infections account for the majority of deaths in untreated patients with AIDS.

The patient may be left with a mild headache.

Most clinical manifestations arise as a consequence of the hyperandrogenism and often include hirsutism beginning at or near puberty and irregular menses from the age of menarche because of oligoovulation or anovulation. Clinical manifestations are as follows: 1. Affected girls may be but are not necessarily somewhat overweight. 2. In rare instances, menarche may be delayed, and primary amenorrhea may occur. 3. Basal levels of LH tend to be elevated in most affected individuals, and androgen production is invariably increased, even though circulating levels of androgens may be near the upper limits of the normal range in many affected women.

It is important to confirm that the patient is not taking exogenous glucocorticoid. Treatment for Women with Amenorrhea in the Presence of Normal Pelvic Anatomy and Normal Secondary Sexual Characteristics The treatment of nonanatomic causes of amenorrhea associated with normal secondary sexual characteristics varies widely according to the cause. The underlying disorder", "A BMI >25 kg/m2 is indicative of excess weight for height, and values >30 kg/m2 are often seen in association with hirsutism, probably the result of increased conversion of androgen precursors to testosterone. Notation should be made of blood pressure, as adrenal causes may be associated with hypertension. Cutaneous signs sometimes associated with androgen excess and insulin resistance include acanthosis nigricans and skin tags. Body fat distribution should also be noted. An objective clinical assessment of hair distribution and quantity is central to the evaluation in any woman presenting with hirsutism. This assessment permits the distinction between hirsutism and hypertrichosis and provides a baseline reference point to gauge the response to treatment. A simple and commonly used method to grade hair growth is the modified scale of Ferriman", "to all surfaces of the vagina, including anterior and posterior areas that may be obscured by the vaginal speculum on examination. For all women, the evaluation of excessive and abnormal menses includes a thorough medical and gynecologic history, the exclusion of pregnancy, the consideration of possible malignancy, and a careful gynecologic examination. For women of normal weight between the ages of approximately 20 and 35 years who do not have clear risk factors for STDs, who have no signs of androgen excess, who are not using exogenous hormones, and who have no other findings on examination, management may be based on a clinical diagnosis.

Because circulating levels of estrogens are not diminished in PCOS and androgen levels are only mildly elevated, affected girls become both feminized and masculinized at puberty. This is an important feature because girls with classic forms of CAH who do not experience precocious puberty (and even those who do) only become masculinized at puberty (i.e., they do not develop breasts). 6.

Laboratory testing for routine care and high-risk factors is presented in Chapter 8. Physical Examination A thorough gynecologic physical examination is typically performed at the time of the initial visit, on a yearly basis, and as needed throughout the course of treatment (Table 1.6). The extent of the physical examination during the gynecologic visit is often dictated by the patient\u2019s primary concerns and symptoms. For example, for healthy teens without symptoms who are requesting oral contraceptives before the initiation of intercourse, a gynecologic examination is not necessarily required. Some aspects of the examination\u2014such as assessment of vital signs and measurement of height, weight, blood pressure, and calculation of a body mass index\u2014 should be performed routinely during most office visits.

Systolic murmurs can be early, mid, late, or holosystolic in timing (Fig. 267-5).

Because RPF decreases more than GFR, filtration fraction increases. The decrease in GFR reduces the filtered amount of Na+ . 2. Na+ reabsorption by the proximal tubule and loop of Henle is increased. Several mechanisms augment Na+ reabsorption in the proximal tubule. For example, increased sympathetic nerve activity and angiotensin II levels directly stimulate Na+ reabsorption. The decreased hydrostatic pressure within the glomerular capillaries also leads to a decrease in the hydrostatic pressure within the peritubular capillaries. In addition, as just noted, the increased filtration fraction results in an increase in the peritubular oncotic pressure. These alterations in the capillary Starling forces facilitate movement of fluid from the lateral intercellular space", "mL/min. Blood reaches each nephron through the afferent arteriole leading into a glomerular capillary where large amounts of fluid and solutes are filtered to form the tubular fluid. The distal ends of the glomerular capillaries coalesce to form an efferent arteriole leading to the first segment of a second capillary network (cortical peritubular capillaries or medullary vasa recta) surrounding the tubules (Fig. 332e-2A). Thus, nephrons have two capillary beds arranged in a series separated by the efferent arteriole that regulates the hydrostatic pressure in both capillary beds. The distal capillaries empty into small venous branches that coalesce into larger veins to eventually form the renal vein. The hydrostatic pressure gradient across the glomerular capillary wall is the primary driving force for glomerular filtration. Oncotic pressure within the capillary", "glomerular capillary is essentially 1. Thus the oncotic pressure in Bowman\u2019s space (\u03c0BS) is near zero. Therefore PGC is the principal force favoring filtration. In contrast, the hydraulic pressure in Bowman\u2019s space (PBS) and the oncotic pressure in the glomerular capillary (\u03c0GC) both oppose filtration. Fig. 33.17 , a net ultrafiltration pressure (PUF) of 17 mm Hg exists at the afferent end of the glomerulus, whereas at the efferent end it is 8 mm Hg (where PUF = PGC \u2212 PBS \u2212\u03c0GC). Two additional points concerning Starling forces and this pressure change are important. First, PGC decreases slightly along the length of the capillary because of the resistance to flow along the length of the capillary. Second, \u03c0GC increases as plasma is filtered while protein is retained within", "filtration. The rate of glomerular filtration is considerably greater in glomerular capillaries than in systemic capillaries, mainly because Kf is approximately 100 times greater in glomerular capillaries. Furthermore PGC is approximately twice as great as the hydraulic pressure in systemic capillaries. GFR can be altered by changing Kf or by changing any of the Starling forces. In normal individuals, GFR is regulated by alterations in PGC that are mediated mainly by changes \u2022 Fig. 33.17 Idealized glomerular capillary and the Starling forces across it. The reflection coefficient (\u03c3) for protein across the glomerular capillary is approximately 1.

The", "also decrease Kf. 2. Changes in PGC: With decreased renal perfusion, GFR declines because PGC falls. As previously discussed, a reduction in PGC is caused by a decline in renal arterial pressure, an increase in afferent arteriolar resistance, or a decrease in efferent arteriolar resistance. 3. Changes in \u03c0GC: An inverse relationship exists between \u03c0GC and GFR. Alterations in \u03c0GC result from changes in protein synthesis outside the kidneys. In addition the protein loss in urine caused by some renal diseases can lead to a decrease in the plasma protein concentration and thus in \u03c0GC. 4. Changes in PBS: Increased PBS reduces GFR, whereas decreased PBS enhances GFR. Acute obstruction of the urinary tract (e.g., a kidney stone occluding the ureter) increases PBS.

Acute obstruction of the urinary tract (e.g., a kidney stone occluding the ureter) increases PBS. Equation 33.11 organ R = resistance to flow through that organ Accordingly, RBF is equal to the pressure difference between the renal artery and the renal vein divided by renal vascular resistance: Equation 33.12 The afferent arteriole, efferent arteriole, and interlobular artery are the major resistance vessels in the kidneys and thereby determine renal vascular resistance. Like most other organs, the kidneys regulate their blood flow by adjusting vascular resistance in response to changes in arterial pressure. As shown in Fig. 33.18 these adjustments are so precise that blood flow remains relatively constant as arterial blood pressure changes between 90 and", "and hence filtration of sodium. In CKD, the TGF becomes a positive feedback process by which increased distal delivery results in increased filtration so that the need to excrete an increased amount of sodium per nephron is achieved. This conversion from a negative feedback process to a positive feedback process may be due to conversion of an adenosine-dominated vasoconstrictive feedback on the afferent arteriole of the glomerulus to a NO-dominated vasodilatory feedback. Like so many of these adaptive responses, this one may turn maladaptive, resulting in higher intraglomerular hydrostatic pressures with increased mechanical strain on the glomerular capillary wall and podocytes and increased glomerulosclerosis as a consequence. acid-base homeostasis The kidneys excrete approximately 1 mEq/kg per day of dietary acid load under normal dietary conditions. With decreased kidney", "hydrostatic pressure closer to normal and thereby prevents marked reductions in GFR if renal blood flow reduction is not excessive. In addition, a myogenic reflex within the afferent arteriole leads to dilation in the setting of low perfusion pressure, thereby maintaining glomerular perfusion. Intrarenal biosynthesis of vasodilator prostaglandins (prostacyclin, prostaglandin E2), kallikrein and kinins, and possibly nitric oxide (NO) also increase in response to low renal perfusion pressure. Autoregulation is also accomplished by tubuloglomerular feedback, in which decreases in solute delivery to the macula densa (specialized cells within the distal tubule) elicit dilation of the juxtaposed afferent arteriole in order to maintain glomerular perfusion, a mechanism mediated, in part, by NO. There is a limit, however, to the ability of these counterregulatory mechanisms to maintain GFR in the", "of the macula densa in controlling renin secretion by granular cells of the afferent arteriole. This aspect of function of the juxtaglomerular apparatus is considered in detail in Because animals engage in many activities that can change arterial blood pressure, mechanisms that maintain RBF and GFR relatively constant despite changes in arterial pressure are highly desirable. If GFR and RBF were to rise or fall suddenly in proportion to changes in blood pressure, urinary excretion of fluid and solute would also change suddenly. Such changes in excretion of water and solutes without comparable changes in intake would alter fluid and electrolyte balance (the reason for which is discussed in ). Accordingly, autoregulation of GFR and RBF provides an effective means for uncoupling renal function from arterial pressure, and", "of Na+ to the beginning of the distal tubule. These processes are autoregulation of the GFR (and thus the filtered load of Na+), glomerulotubular balance, and load dependency of Na+ reabsorption by the loop of Henle. Autoregulation of the GFR (see ) allows maintenance of a relatively constant filtration rate over a wide range of perfusion pressures. Because the filtration rate is constant, the filtered load of Na+ is also constant. Despite the autoregulatory control of GFR, small variations occur. If these changes are not compensated for by an appropriate adjustment in Na+ reabsorption by the nephron, Na+ excretion would change markedly. Fortunately, Na+ reabsorption in the euvolemic state, especially by the proximal tubule, changes in parallel with changes in GFR. This phenomenon is termed glomerulotubular balance.

Pattern Myocardial ischemic discomfort usually builds over minutes and is exacerbated by activity and mitigated by rest. In contrast, pain that reaches its peak intensity immediately is more suggestive of aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, or spontaneous pneumothorax.

At first, the patellar and Achilles reflexes are diminished as frequently as they are increased; they may even be absent. This is most likely the result of a neuropathy due to multiple vitamin deficiencies as cases of pure cobalamin loss, for example due to nitrous oxide, almost never obliterate the tendon reflexes. This controversy regarding the presence of a polyneuropathy as a component of SCD has already been alluded to. The gait at first is predominantly ataxic, later ataxic and spastic.

In addition to sensory loss, examination usually discloses a loss of tendon reflexes and weakness in the distal muscles of the legs. Severe degrees of weakness and loss of deep sensation are observed only rarely. Isoniazid produces its effects on the peripheral nerves by interfering with pyridoxine metabolism, perhaps by inhibiting the phosphorylation of pyridoxine (the collective name for the B6 group of vitamins) and decreasing the tissue levels of its active form, pyridoxal phosphate. The administration of 150 to 450 mg of pyridoxine daily in conjunction with the isoniazid completely prevents the neuropathy.

EDx shows nonspecific findings of an axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy. When a diagnosis of thiamine deficiency is made or suspected, thiamine replacement should be provided until proper nutrition is restored. Thiamine is usually given intravenously or intramuscularly at a dose of 100 mg/d.

Perhaps sprue is able to cause a neuropathy with minimal gastrointestinal symptoms. Vitamin B12 deficiency should be sought in cases of large-fiber neuropathy. A difficult problem is that of an older person with a mild, nonprogressive sensorimotor polyneuropathy in whom there is evidence of mild hypothyroidism, marginally low vitamin B12 and folic acid levels in the blood, a somewhat unbalanced diet, perhaps an excessive alcohol intake, and an abnormal glucose tolerance response. It is easy to propose but hard to prove that any of these factors is relevant. Vitamin replacement should be undertaken nonetheless if no other cause is found.

A preferential large-fiber sensory loss affecting proprioception and vibration with sparing of small-fiber modalities is present; an unsteady gait reflects sensory ataxia. These features, coupled with diffuse hyperreflexia and absent Achilles reflexes, should always focus attention on the possibility of cobalamin deficiency. Optic atrophy and, in severe cases, behavioral changes ranging from mild irritability and forgetfulness to severe dementia and frank psychosis may appear. The full clinical picture of subacute combined degeneration is uncommon. CNS manifestations, especially pyramidal tract signs, may be missing, and in fact some patients may only exhibit symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. EDx shows an axonal sensorimotor neuropathy.

This imparts a \u201ctabetic\u201d unsteadiness to the gait. Sensory defects tend to be asymmetrical. (It is noteworthy that symmetric sensory symptoms and signs of identical type are seen with subacute combined degeneration as a result of vitamin B12 deficiency.) Less frequently, paresthesias and dysesthesias in the lower extremities and trunk may be the principal symptoms; even less often there are sensory complaints on the face, ostensibly corresponding to compression of the trigeminal sensory tract in the upper cervical cord. Rarely, the sensorimotor pattern takes the form of a Brown-S\u00e9quard syndrome.

Response of this condition to antiretrovirals has been variable, perhaps because antiretrovirals are responsible for the problem in some instances. When due to dideoxynucleoside therapy, patients with lower extremity peripheral neuropathy may complain of a sensation that they are walking on ice. Other entities in the differential diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy include diabetes mellitus, vitamin B12 deficiency, and side effects from metronidazole or dapsone. For distal symmetric polyneuropathy that fails to resolve following the discontinuation of dideoxynucleosides, therapy is symptomatic; gabapentin, carbamazepine, tricyclics, or analgesics may be effective for dysesthesias.

Because of the increasing prevalence of CML (cost of TKI therapy) and the emerging long-term low rates of significant organ toxicities, the ultimate goal of CML therapy in the research setting is to achieve eradication of the disease (molecular cure) that is prolonged and durable, with recovery of nonneoplastic, nonclonal hematopoiesis off TKI therapy.

Patients in accelerated or blastic phase may receive therapy with TKIs, preferably secondor third-generation TKIs (dasatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, ponatinib), alone or in combination with chemotherapy, to reduce the CML burden, before undergoing allogeneic SCT.

Cytogenetic 694 responses, particularly complete cytogenetic responses, are uncommon (10\u201330%) and transient in blastic phase.

Mechanism of interaction: There should be a clear understanding of the biochemical, molecular, and pharmacokinetic mechanisms of interaction between the individual drugs in a given combination, to allow for maximal antitumor effect.

The importance of careful and complete reporting of toxicity by physicians after marketing begins can be appreciated by noting that many important drug-induced effects have an incidence of 1 in 10,000 or less and that some adverse effects may become apparent only after chronic dosing. The sample size required to disclose drug-induced events or toxicities is very large for such rare events. For example, several hundred thousand patients may have to be exposed before the first case is observed of a toxicity that occurs with an average incidence of 1 in 10,000. Therefore, low-incidence drug effects are not generally detected before phase 4 no matter how carefully phase 1, 2, and 3 studies are executed. Phase 4 has no", "change to other TKIs as indicated, can be associated with close to normal survival. Therefore, in standard practice, achievement and maintenance of a complete cytogenetic response are the aims of therapy, because complete cytogenetic response is the only treatment-related factor associated with survival prolongation. Lack of achievement of a major molecular response (protects against events; associated with longer event-free survival) or of negative BCR-ABL1 transcripts (offers the potential of TKI interruption on investigational studies) should not be considered indications to change TKI therapy or to consider allogeneic SCT.

This allows many patients to undergo allogeneic SCT in a state of minimal CML burden or secondary chronic phase, which are associated with higher cure rates. In CML nonlymphoid blastic phase, anti-AML chemotherapy combined with TKIs results in CR rates of 30\u201350% and median survival times of 9\u201312 months (compared with historical response rates of 20\u201330% and median survival times of 3\u20135 months).

Historically, before the availability of TKIs, patients without cytogenetic response on interferon \u03b1 or hydroxy-urea had expected short median survival times (2\u20133 years) with expected rapid disease transformation. The maturing experience with TKIs suggests a different course, whereby patients may remain in chronic phase on TKI-based therapies (combinations including hydroxyurea, cytarabine, decitabine, and others), with or without cytogenetic response, for many years. Table 133-3 summarizes a general guidance to the choice of TKIs versus allogeneic SCT.

Physical Examination A thorough gynecologic physical examination is typically performed at the time of the initial visit, on a yearly basis, and as needed throughout the course of treatment (Table 1.6). The extent of the physical examination during the gynecologic visit is often dictated by the patient\u2019s primary concerns and symptoms. For example, for healthy teens without symptoms who are requesting oral contraceptives before the initiation of intercourse, a gynecologic examination is not necessarily required.

Newborn weight exceeding 4000 g (8 lb 13 oz) is also a frequently used threshold to deine macrosomia. Others use 4250 g or even 4500 g (10 lb). As shown in Table 44-2, birthweights ::4500 g are uncommon.

Although there is general agreement among obstetricians that neonates weighing < 4000 g are not excessively large, a similar consensus has not been reached for the definition of macrosomia. Newborn weight rarely exceeds 11 pounds (5000 g), and excessively large infants are a curiosity. The largest newborn cited in the Guinness Book of World Records was a 23-lb 12-oz (10,800 g) infant boy born in 1879 to a Canadian woman (Barnes, 1957).

Before the 15th edition of this textbook, apreterm orpremature newborn was deined by a birthweight <2500 g. With that edition, preterm neonates were considered to be those delivered before 37 completed weeks, that is, <366r weeks (Pritchard, 1976). This definition, which has now been in use for more than 40 years, was first promulgated in 1976 by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Federation FIGURE 42-1", "weights < 5th percentile had a higher risk of low 5-minute Apgar score, respiratory distress, necrotizing enterocolitis, and neonatal sepsis than appropriate-weight neonates.

In one study of more that 44,561 neonates, only 14 percent of those weighing < 1st percentile at birth survived to discharge (Griin, 2015). For those infants who survive, the risks of adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes are substantial, especially for growth-impaired fetuses with either brain sparing or a major birth defect (Meher, 2015; Nelson, 2015b).

Between 18 and 30 weeks' gestation, the uterine fundal height in centimeters coincides within 2 weeks of gestational age. Thus, if the measurement is more than 2 to 3 cm from the expected height, inappropriate fetal growth is suspected and sonography is considered. One supporting point for routine sonographic evaluation of all pregnancies is the opportunity to diagnose growth restriction.

Disorders can also be grouped according to gas exchange abnormalities, including hypoxemic, hypercarbic, or combined impairment. However, many diseases of the lung do not manifest as gas exchange abnormalities. As with the evaluation of most patients, the approach to a patient with disease of the respiratory system begins with a thorough history and a focused physical examination. Many patients will subsequently undergo pulmonary function testing, chest imaging, blood and sputum analysis, a variety of serologic or microbiologic studies, and diagnostic procedures, such as bronchoscopy. This stepwise approach is discussed in detail below. HISTORY Dyspnea and Cough The cardinal symptoms of respiratory disease are dyspnea and cough (Chaps. 47e and 48). Dyspnea has many", "discontinuation of exposure. Objective testing can establish the diagnosis of asthma (airflow obstruction on spirometry that varies over time or reverses in response to a bronchodilator) or exclude it with certainty (a negative response to a bronchoprovocation challenge\u2014e.g., with methacholine). In a patient capable of taking reliable measurements, home expiratory peak flow monitoring can be a cost-effective method to support or discount a diagnosis of asthma. Chronic eosinophilic bronchitis causes chronic cough with a normal chest radiograph. This condition is characterized by sputum eosinophilia in excess of 3% without airflow obstruction or bronchial hyperresponsiveness and is successfully treated with inhaled glucocorticoids. Treatment of chronic cough in a patient with a normal chest radio-graph is often empirical and is targeted at the most likely cause(s) of cough as determined", "weeks. The prolonged nature of these infections promotes the use of antibiotics to \u201cclear up the infection\u201d (8). Sputum production commonly occurs and may be prolonged in cigarette smokers. Most serious bacterial infections occur in cigarette smokers, who have damage to the lining of the upper respiratory tree and changes in the host \ufb02ora. Physical examination discloses a variety of upper airway sounds, usually coarse rhonchi. Rales are usually not present on auscultation, and signs of consolidation and alveolar involvement are absent. During auscultation of the chest, signs of pneumonia such as fine rales, decreased breath sounds, and euphonia (\u201cE to A changes\u201d) should be sought. If the results of the physical examination are uncertain or the patient\u2019s condition appears to be in respiratory distress chest radiography should", "order to diagnose any life-threatening diseases rapidly (e.g., pulmonary embolism or multilobar pneumonia). In contrast, chronic dyspnea and cough can be evaluated in a more protracted, stepwise fashion. Pulmonary Function Testing (See also Chap. 307) The initial pulmonary function test obtained is spirometry. This study is an effort-dependent test used to assess for obstructive pathophysiology as seen in asthma, COPD, and bronchiectasis. A diminished-forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) (often defined as <70% of the predicted value) is diagnostic of obstruction. In addition to measuring FEV1 and FVC, the clinician should examine the flow-volume loop (which is effort-independent). A plateau of the inspiratory and expiratory curves suggests large-airway obstruction in extrathoracic and intrathoracic locations, respectively. Spirometry with symmetric decreases in FEV1 and FVC warrants", "be the initial complaints. Weight loss is common and may be severe enough to suggest an occult malignant tumor. Pulmonary function tests reveal reduced FEV1 with normal or near-normal FVC. Hence, the FEV1 to FVC ratio is reduced. The classic presentation of emphysema with no \u201cbronchitic\u201d component is one in which the patient is barrel-chested and dyspneic, with obviously prolonged expiration, sitting forward in a hunched-over position. In these patients, air space enlargement is severe and diffusing capacity is low. Dyspnea and hyperventilation are prominent, so that until very late in the disease, gas exchange is adequate and blood gas values are relatively normal. Because of prominent dyspnea and adequate oxygenation of hemoglobin, these patients sometimes are sometimes called \u201cpink puffers.\u201d At the other end of the clinical", "over weeks to months, with cough, low-grade fevers, progressive dyspnea, weight loss, wheezing, malaise, and night sweats, and a chest x-ray with migratory bilateral peripheral or pleural-based opacities. Although this \u201cphotographic negative pulmonary edema\u201d appearance on chest x-ray and chest CT is pathognomonic of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, less than 25% of patients present with this finding. Other radiographic findings include atelectasis, pleural effusions, lymphadenopathy, and septal line thickening. Almost 90% of patients have peripheral eosinophilia, with mean eosinophil counts of over 30% of total white blood cell count. BAL eosinophilia is also an important distinguishing feature with mean BAL eosinophil counts of close to 60%. Both peripheral and BAL eosinophilia are very responsive to treatment with corticosteroids. Other laboratory features of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia include increased ESR, C-reactive", "complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan. In the third scenario, a 46-year-old patient with hemoptysis who immigrated from a developing country has an echocardiogram as well, because the physician hears a soft diastolic rumbling murmur at the apex on cardiac auscultation, suggesting rheumatic mitral stenosis and possibly pulmonary hypertension. Although rapid, pattern recognition used without sufficient reflection can result in premature closure: mistakenly concluding that one already knows the correct diagnosis and therefore failing to complete the data collection that would demonstrate the lack of fit", "cough for at least 3 consecutive months in at least 2 consecutive years. It is common among cigarette smokers and urban dwellers in smog-ridden cities; some studies indicate that 20% to 25% of men in the 40to 65-year-old age group have the disease. In early stages of the disease, the cough raises mucoid sputum, but airflow is not obstructed. Some patients with chronic bronchitis have evidence of hyperresponsive airways, with intermittent bronchospasm and wheezing (asthmatic bronchitis), while other bronchitic patients, especially heavy smokers, develop chronic outflow obstruction, usually with associated emphysema (COPD). The distinctive feature of chronic bronchitis is hypersecretion of mucus, beginning in the large airways. Although the most important cause is cigarette smoking, other air pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide, may contribute. These", "analytic approach along with more intensive and comprehensive data collection to reach the diagnosis.

This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung.

The physical examination in cardiogenic pulmonary edema is notable for evidence of increased intracardiac pressures (S3 gallop, elevated jugular venous pulse, peripheral edema) and rales and/or wheezes on auscultation of the chest. In contrast, the physical examination in noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is dominated by the findings of the precipitating condition; pulmonary findings may be relatively normal in the early stages. The chest radiograph in cardiogenic pulmonary edema typically shows an enlarged cardiac silhouette, vascular redistribution, interstitial thickening, and perihilar alveolar infiltrates; pleural effusions are common. In noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, heart size is normal, alveolar infiltrates are distributed more uniformly throughout the lungs, and pleural effusions are uncommon. Finally,", "Hypoxia is common, as are nonspecific ST-segment and T-wave changes on the electrocardiogram (ECG). The P2 heart sound may be increased, and an S4 sound may be present. Although the chest x-ray is usually normal, atelectasis or cardiomegaly may be seen. The measurement of D-dimers can be used as a screening test, but it must be interpreted in light of the probability of a pulmonary embolism. If the D-dimer is normal and the probability for embolism is low, then no further workup may be necessary. However, if the D-dimer is elevated, or if it is normal but the probability of embolism is moderate or high, then the diagnostic test of choice is a CT angiogram of the chest.

When these signs are positive, a volume-overloaded state with limited compliance of an overly distended or constricted venous system is present. The abdominojugular reflex is elicited with firm and consistent pressure over the upper portion of the abdomen, preferably over the right upper quadrant, for at least 10 s.

Signs of a potentially fatal attack include central cyanosis and altered consciousness. Arterial blood gas analysis provides objective assessment of maternal oxygenation, ventilation, and acid-base status. With this information, the severity of an acute attack can be assessed (see Fig. 51-1). That said, in a prospective evaluation, Wendel and associates (1996) found that routine arterial blood gas analysis did not help to manage most pregnant women who required admission for", "pattern approximates 50 percent (Clark, 1984; Smith, 1986). his physiological response shows a gradual fetal heart rate decline and then return to baseline associated with a contraction (Fig. Freeman and associates (2003) defined early decelerations as those generally seen in active labor between 4 and 7 cm cervical dilation. In their deinition, the degree of deceleration is generally proportional to the contraction strength and rarely falls below 100 to 110 bpm or 20 to 30 bpm below baseline. Such decelerations are common during active labor and not associated with tachycardia, loss of variability, or other fetal heart rate changes. Importantly, early decelerations are not associated with fetal hypoxia, acidemia, or low Apgar scores. FIGURE 24-11 Features of early fetal heart rate deceleration.

These results suggest that normal human labor is relatively short. \u2022 Summary of Normal Labor Labor is characterized by brevity and considerable biological variation. Active labor can be reliably diagnosed when cervical dilation is :3 cm in the presence of uterine contractions. Once this cervical dilation threshold is reached, normal progression to delivery can be expected, depending on parity, in the ensuing 4 to 6 hours. Anticipated progress during a 1-to 3-hour second stage is monitored to ensure fetal safety. Finally, most women in spontaneous labor, regardless of parity, if left unaided, will deliver within approximately 10 hours after admission for spontaneous labor. Insuicient uterine activity is a common and correctable cause", "contractions. The deceleration measures : 15 bpm for : 15 seconds and has an onset-to-nadir phase of <30 seconds. Total duration is <2 minutes. oxytocin stimulation. Maternal diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and collagen vascular disorders can cause chronic placental dysfunction. Placental abruption can produce acute late decelerations. he most frequent deceleration patterns encountered during labor are variable decelerations attributed to umbilical cord occlusion. In a study of more than 7000 monitor tracings, variable decelerations were identified in 40 percent when labor had progressed to 5 cm dilation and in 83 percent by the end of first-stage labor (Melchior, 1985).

False labor often stops spontaneously, or it may proceed rapidly into efective contractions. A second method deines the onset of labor as beginning at the time of admission to the labor unit. In the United States, admission for labor is frequently based on the extent of cervical dilation accompanied by painful contractions. If a woman has intact membranes, then a cervical dilation of3 to 4 cm or greater is presumed to be a reasonably reliable threshold for the diagnosis of labor.

Gynecologists and Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine (2016c) has redefined active labor to begin at 6 cm. A uller discussion of these labor changes is found in Chapter 23 (p. 445). his concept of a latent phase has great signiicance in understanding normal human labor, because labor is considerably longer when a latent phase is included. To better illustrate this, labor was diagnosed beginning with their admission, rather than with the onset of regular contractions.

Among 768 women in this study at Parkland Hospital, active labor deined as cervical dilation ::4 cm was diagnosed within 24 hours in three fourths of women with ::12 contractions per hour. Bailit and coworkers (2005) compared labor outcomes of 6121 women who presented in active labor deined as uterine contractions plus cervical dilation ::4 cm with those of 2697 women who presented in the latent phase. Women admitted during latent-phase labor had more active-phase arrest, more frequent need for oxytocin labor stimulation, and higher rates of chorioamnionitis. It was concluded that physician interventions in women presenting in the latent phase may have been the cause of subsequent labor abnormalities. In those instances when", "six times each 10 minutes. Hauth and coworkers (1986) quantiied uterine contraction pressures in 109 women at term who received oxytocin for labor induction or augmentation. Most of these women achieved 200 to 225 Montevideo units, and 40 percent had up to 300 units to efect delivery. The authors suggested that these levels of uterine activity should be sought before consideration of cesarean delivery for presumed dystocia (Chap. 23, p. 443). Interestingly, the duration of uterine contractions-60 to 80 seconds-does not lengthen appreciably from early active labor through the second stage (Bakker, 2007; Pontonnier, 1975). Presumably, this duration constancy serves fetal respiratory gas exchange. During a uterine contraction, as the intrauterine pressure exceeds that of the intervillous space, respiratory gas exchange is halted.

Women with overt new-onset hypertension-either diastolic pressures \ufffd90 mm Hg or systolic pressures \ufffd 140 mm Hg-are admitted to determine if the increase is due to preeclampsia, and if so, to evaluate its severity.

Between 18 and 30 weeks' gestation, the uterine fundal height in centimeters coincides within 2 weeks of gestational age. Thus, if the measurement is more than 2 to 3 cm from the expected height, inappropriate fetal growth is suspected and sonography is considered. One supporting point for routine sonographic evaluation of all pregnancies is the opportunity to diagnose growth restriction. Typically, such routine screening incorporates an early initial sonographic examination-usually at 16 to 20 weeks' gestation. Increasingly, a first-trimester examination is added to establish gestational age and identiy anomalies.

The pain attributable to FM is poorly localized, difficult to ignore, severe in its intensity, and associated with a reduced functional capacity. For a diagnosis of FM, pain should have been present most of the day on most days for at least 3 months. The clinical pain of FM is associated with increased evoked pain sensitivity.

Patients with FM often have peripheral pain generators that are thought to serve as triggers for the more widespread pain attributed to central nervous system factors. Potential pain generators such as arthritis, bursitis, tendinitis, neuropathies, and other inflammatory or degenerative conditions should be identified by history and physical examination. More subtle pain generators may include joint hypermobility and scoliosis. In addition, patients may have chronic myalgias triggered by infectious, metabolic, or psychiatric conditions that", "sometimes after a viral illness, is unremitting for months or longer and resistant to treatment. There is a common association with the similarly obscure entity of fibromyalgia, consisting of neck, shoulder, and paraspinal pain and point tenderness, as described in Chaps. 10 and 45. Despite these complaints, the patient may look surprisingly well and the neurologic examination is normal. The term for this same chronic fatigue entity, myalgic encephalomyelitis, is preferred in Great Britain and captures the association between the two syndromes.

Approximately 25% of x-rays in this clinical situation will be abnormal, with the most frequent findings being pneumonia and congestive heart failure. Patients with advanced COPD, those with a history of hypercarbia, those with mental status changes (confusion, sleepiness), or those in significant distress should have an arterial blood-gas measurement.

If on the second attempt the needle still hits bone (indicating lack of success in introducing it between the spinous processes), then the needle should be completely withdrawn and the patient should be repositioned. The second attempt is sometimes more successful if the patient straightens the spine completely prior to repositioning. The needle can then be reinserted at the same level or at an adjacent one. Once the SAS is reached, a manometer is attached to the needle and the opening pressure measured.

When measured with the needle in the lumbar sac and the patient in a sitting position, the fluid in the manometer rises to the level of the cisterna magna (pressure is approximately double that obtained in the recumbent position). It fails to reach the level of the ventricles because the latter are in a closed system under slight negative pressure, whereas the fluid in the manometer is influenced by atmospheric pressure. Normally, with the needle properly placed in the subarachnoid space, the fluid in the manometer oscillates through a few millimeters in response to the pulse and respiration and rises promptly with coughing, straining, and", "least 10 s. A positive response is defined by a sustained rise of more than 3 cm in JVP for at least 15 s after release of the hand. Patients must be coached to refrain from breath holding or a Valsalva-like maneuver during the procedure. The abdominojugular reflex is useful in predicting a pulmonary artery wedge pressure in excess of 15 mmHg in patients with heart failure. Although the JVP estimates right ventricular filling pressure, it has a predictable relationship with the pulmonary artery wedge pressure.

Low-pressure tamponade refers to mild tamponade in which the intrapericardial pressure is increased from its slightly subatmospheric levels to +5 to +10 mmHg; in some instances, hypovolemia coexists. As a consequence, the central venous pressure is normal or only slightly elevated, whereas arterial pressure is unaffected and there is no paradoxical pulse.

As with the evaluation of most patients, the approach to a patient with disease of the respiratory system begins with a thorough history and a focused physical examination. Many patients will subsequently undergo pulmonary function testing, chest imaging, blood and sputum analysis, a variety of serologic or microbiologic studies, and diagnostic procedures, such as bronchoscopy.

Pulmonary function studies (Chap. 306e), including spirometry, diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide, lung volumes, and arterial Paco2 and O2 saturation, usually make it possible to determine if respiratory acidosis is secondary to lung disease. The workup for nonpulmonary causes should include a detailed drug history, measurement of hematocrit, and assessment of upper airway, chest wall, pleura, and neuromuscular function. The management of respiratory acidosis depends on its severity and rate of onset. Acute respiratory acidosis can be life-threatening, and measures to reverse the underlying cause should be undertaken simultaneously with restoration of adequate alveolar ventilation. This may necessitate tracheal intubation and assisted mechanical ventilation. Oxygen administration should be titrated carefully in patients with severe obstructive pulmonary disease and chronic CO2", "results predicted from normal healthy volunteers. Predicted or normal values vary with age, sex, ethnicity, height, and to a lesser extent, weight ( Table 22.1 ). Abnormalities in values indicate abnormal pulmonary function and can be used to predict abnormalities in gas exchange. These values can detect the presence of abnormal lung function long before respiratory symptoms develop, and they can be used to determine disease severity and the response to therapy. The Spirogram A spirogram displays the volume of gas exhaled as a function of time (see Fig. 22.3A ) and measures: (1) forced vital capacity (FVC), (2) forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), (3) the ratio of FEV1 to FVC (FEV1/ FVC), and (4) the average midmaximal expiratory flow (FEF25-75).

Patients with exertional dyspnea should be asked to walk under observation in order to reproduce the symptoms. The patient should be examined during and at the end of exercise for new findings that were not present at rest and for changes in oxygen saturation. After the history elicitation and the physical examination, a chest radiograph should be obtained. The lung volumes should be assessed: hyperinflation indicates obstructive lung disease, whereas low lung volumes suggest interstitial edema or fibrosis, diaphragmatic dysfunction, or impaired chest wall motion. The pulmonary parenchyma should be examined for", "complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung. Consequently, along with the chest x-ray, the physician obtains a sputum cytology examination and refers this patient for a chest computed tomography (CT) scan. In the third scenario, a 46-year-old patient with hemoptysis who immigrated from a developing country has an echocardiogram as well, because the physician hears a soft diastolic rumbling murmur at the apex on cardiac auscultation, suggesting rheumatic mitral stenosis and possibly pulmonary hypertension.

Additional testing, such as measurements of maximal expiratory pressure and maximal inspiratory pressure, can help diagnose neuromuscular weakness. Normal spirometry, normal lung volumes, and a low DLCO should prompt further evaluation for pulmonary vascular disease. Arterial blood gas testing is often helpful in assessing respiratory 1663 disease. Hypoxemia, while usually apparent with pulse oximetry, can be further evaluated with the measurement of arterial PO2 and the calculation of an alveolar gas and arterial blood oxygen tension difference ([A\u2013a]DO2). Patients with diseases that cause ventilation-perfusion mismatch or shunt physiology have an increased (A\u2013a) DO2 at rest. Arterial blood gas testing also allows the measurement of arterial PCO2.

Cough is almost always present, and coryza and regional lymphadenopathy are frequently seen.

The leading causes of pharyngitis are respiratory viruses (rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, coronaviruses, adenoviruses; ~25% of cases), group A streptococci (15\u201330%), group C streptococci (~5%), atypical bacteria such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae (15\u201320% in some series), and other viruses such as herpes simplex virus (~4%) and Epstein-Barr virus (<1% in infectious mononucleosis). Less common causes are", "and patients who have been symptomatic for >4 weeks, increasing attention is being given to serologic diagnosis. Enzyme immunoassays detecting IgA and IgG antibodies to pertussis toxin, filamentous hemagglutinin, pertactin, and fimbriae have been developed and assessed for reproducibility. Twoor fourfold increases in antibody titer are suggestive of pertussis, although cross-reactivity of some antigens (such as filamentous hemagglutinin and pertactin) among Bordetella species makes it difficult to depend diagnostically on seroconversion involving a single type of antibody.

Criteria for serologic diagnosis based on comparison of results for a single serum specimen with established population values are gaining acceptance, and serologic measurement of antibody to pertussis toxin is becoming more widely standardized and available for diagnostic purposes, particularly in outbreak settings and for surveillance. A child presenting with paroxysmal cough, posttussive vomiting, and whoop is likely to have an infection caused by B. pertussis or B. parapertussis; lymphocytosis increases the likelihood of a B. pertussis etiology. Viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus have been isolated from patients with clinical pertussis but probably represent co-infection. In adolescents and adults, who often do not have paroxysmal cough or whoop, the differential diagnosis of a prolonged coughing illness is more extensive.

Cultures and rapid diagnostic tests for other causes of acute pharyngitis, such as influenza virus, adenovirus, HSV, EBV, CMV, and M. pneumoniae, are available in many locations and can be used when suspected. The diagnosis of acute EBV infection depends primarily on the detection of antibodies to the virus with a heterophile agglutination assay (monospot slide test) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Testing for HIV RNA or antigen (p24) should be performed when acute primary HIV infection is suspected. If other bacterial causes are suspected (particularly N. gonorrhoeae, C. diphtheriae, or Y. enterocolitica), specific cultures should be requested since these organisms may be missed on routine throat swab culture.

Parainfluenza virus pneumonia and secondary bacterial pneumonia are more common in immunocompromised persons. Bacterial tracheitis may also be a complication of croup. The prognosis for croup is excellent. Illness usually lasts approximately 5 days. As children grow, they become less susceptible to the airway effects of viral infections of the middle respiratory tract. There is no vaccine for parainfluenza.

The prevalence of vaccines has shifted the incidence of diphtheria from children worldwide to countries without routine immunization and to older populations who have lost their immunity. The bacillus releases a toxin that impairs protein synthesis and may particularly affect the conduction system. The specific antitoxin should be administered as soon as possible, with higher priority than antibiotic therapy. Other systemic bacterial infections that can involve the heart include brucellosis, chlamydophila, legionella, meningococcus, mycoplasma, psittacosis, and salmonellosis, for which specific treatment is directed at the systemic infection.

Antibiotic treatment of pharyngitis due to S. pyogenes confers numerous benefits, including a decrease in the risk of rheumatic fever, the primary focus of treatment. The magnitude of this benefit is fairly small, since rheumatic fever is now a rare disease, even among untreated patients. Nevertheless, when therapy is started within 48 h of illness onset, symptom duration is decreased modestly. An additional benefit of therapy is the potential to reduce the transmission of streptococcal pharyngitis, particularly in areas of overcrowding or close contact.

Patients with symptomatic prostatitis should have a course of antibiotics before biopsy. However, the routine use of antibiotics in an asymptomatic man with an elevated PSA level is strongly discouraged. Prostate Biopsy A diagnosis of cancer is established by an image-guided needle biopsy. Direct visualization by transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) assures that all areas of the gland are sampled. Contemporary schemas advise an extended-pattern 12-core biopsy that includes sampling from the peripheral zone as well as a lesion-directed palpable nodule or suspicious image-guided sampling. Men with an abnormal PSA and negative biopsy are advised to undergo a repeat biopsy. BioPsy Pathology Each core of", "number of limitations. PSA is a product of prostatic epithelium and is normally secreted in the semen. Although PSA screening can detect prostate cancers early in their course, studies of the natural history of the disease (so-called \u201cwatch-and-wait studies\u201d) have confirmed that many prostate cancers are clinically insignificant, requiring no treatment, sometimes for decades. Overtreatment of these indolent cancers can cause significant morbidity, particularly erectile dysfunction and incontinence. A second limitation of PSA as a biomarker is that it is not cancer-specific. BPH, prostatitis, prostatic infarcts, instrumentation of the prostate, and ejaculation all may increase serum PSA levels. Conversely, 20% to 40% of patients with organ-confined prostate cancer have PSA values below the cutoffs that are used to identify patients who are likely to have prostate cancer. Because", "to whether screening should be offered unless the patient specifically asks to be screened. Virtually all organizations stress the importance of informing men about the uncertainty regarding screening efficacy and the harms associated with screening. Prostate cancer screening clearly detects many asymptomatic cancers, but the ability to distinguish tumors that are lethal but still curable from those that pose little or no threat to health is limited, and randomized trials indicate that the effect of PSA screening on prostate cancer mortality across a population is, at best, small. Men older than age 50 years have a high prevalence of indolent, clinically insignificant prostate cancers (about 30\u201350% of men, increasing further as men age). Two major randomized controlled trials of the impact of PSA screening on prostate cancer mortality", "waiting or deferred therapy, is the policy of monitoring the illness at fixed intervals with DREs, PSA measurements, and repeat prostate biopsies as indicated until histopathologic or serologic changes correlative of progression warrant treatment with curative intent. It evolved from studies that evaluated predominantly elderly men with well-differentiated tumors who demonstrated no clinically significant progression for protracted periods, recognition of the contrast between incidence and disease-specific mortality, the high prevalence of autopsy cancers, and an effort to reduce overtreatment. A recent screening study estimated that between 50\u2013100 men with low-risk disease would need to be treated to prevent one prostate cancer\u2013specific death. Arguing against active surveillance are the results of a Swedish randomized trial of radical prostatectomy versus active surveillance. With a median follow-up of 6.2 years, men", "men in the control arm received at least one PSA test during the trial, which may have potentially diluted a small effect. The European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) was a multinational study that randomized approximately 182,000 men between age 50 and 74 years (with a predefined \u201ccore\u201d screening group of men age 55\u201369 years) to receive PSA testing or no screening. Recruitment and randomization procedures, as well as actual frequency of PSA testing, varied by country. After a median follow-up of 11 years, a 20% relative reduction in the risk of prostate cancer death in the screened arm was noted in the \u201ccore\u201d screening group. The trial found that 1055 men would need to be invited to screening, and 37 cases of prostate cancer", "100). This uncertainty about the natural history is also reflected in the controversy about treatment of prostate cancer, further contributing to the challenge of screening in this disease. Finally, screening programs can incur significant economic costs that must be considered in the context of the available resources and alternative strategies for improving health outcomes. Because screening and preventive interventions are recommended to asymptomatic individuals, they are held to a high standard for demonstrating a favorable risk-benefit ratio before implementation. In general, the principles of evidence-based medicine apply to demonstrating the efficacy of screening tests and preventive interventions, where randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with mortality outcomes are the gold standard. However, because RCTs are often not feasible, observational studies, such as case-control designs, have been used to assess the", "antiGen levelS Testosterone replacement therapy increases prostate volume to the size seen in age-matched controls but does not increase prostate volume beyond that expected for age. There is no evidence that testosterone therapy causes prostate cancer. However, androgen administration can exacerbate preexisting metastatic prostate cancer. Many older men harbor microscopic foci of cancer in their prostates. It is not known whether long-term testosterone administration will induce these microscopic foci to grow into clinically significant cancers. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels are lower in testosterone-deficient men and are restored to normal after testosterone replacement. There is considerable test-retest variability in PSA measurements. Increments in PSA levels after testosterone supplementation in androgen-deficient men are generally <0.5 ng/mL, and increments >1.0 ng/mL over a 3to 6-month period are unusual.

At 13 years of follow-up, no statistically significant difference in the number of prostate cancer deaths were noted between the arms (rate ratio 1.09; 95% confidence interval 0.87\u20131.36).

In adults, screening tests for diabetes mellitus, renal disease, prostate cancer (measurement of serum prostate-specific antigen [PSA] levels), and colorectal cancer (testing for occult blood in stool), for example, are widely applied to apparently healthy individuals on the grounds that early diagnosis and intervention lead to improved long-term outcomes.

The patient underwent surgery and was found to have a ruptured fallopian tube caused by an ectopic pregnancy.

On examination, there may be no abnormalities other than galactorrhea. Serum prolactin concentrations are increased (usually in excess of 100 ng/mL). In general, the longer the duration of amenorrhea and the higher the serum prolactin level, the larger the tumor (prolactinoma). The elevated prolactin levels distinguish this disorder from idiopathic galactorrhea, in which the serum prolactin concentration is normal.

Women who discontinue OC use after tubal sterilization will experience more dysmenorrhea and menstrual irregularity, which is unrelated to the sterilization. The best answer available comes from the CREST study (302). A total of 9,514 women who underwent tubal sterilization were compared with 573 women whose partners had undergone vasectomy.

For this reason, routine use of codeine, especially in pediatric age groups, is now being eliminated in the United States. The synthetic opioid methadone is metabolized through several CYP450 pathways, in part accounting for its highly variable bioavailability. The most important hepatic pathway for metabolism is CYP2B6.

Example: Codeine is a phenanthrene derivative prodrug opioid analgesic indicated for the management of mild to moderately severe pain (Chapter 31). Codeine, like its active metabolite morphine, binds to \u03bc-opioid receptors in the central nervous system (CNS).

Codeine, dihydrocodeine, and hydrocodone have lower binding affinity to \u03bc-opioid receptors than morphine and often have adverse effects that limit the maximum tolerated dose when one attempts to achieve analgesia comparable to that of morphine. Oxycodone is more potent and is prescribed alone in higher doses as immediate-release or controlled-release forms for the treatment of moderate to severe pain.

Although less common, patients may have \u201cend-of-dose failure\u201d with long-acting opioids, meaning that they develop pain after 8 h in the case of an every-12-h medication. In these cases, a trial of giving an every-12-h medication every 8 h is appropriate.

One of the principal errors made by physicians in this setting is failure to match the severity of a patient\u2019s pain to his or her analgesic. Just as important is the principle that following delivery of the therapeutic plan, its effectiveness must be monitored and reevaluated and the plan modified if necessary. Use of opioid drugs in acute situations should be contrasted with their use in chronic pain management, in which a multitude of other factors must be considered, including the development of tolerance, dependence, and the rarer cases of diversion or misuse.

If nonopioid analgesics are insufficient, opioids should be introduced. They work by interacting with \u00b5 opioid receptors in the CNS to activate pain-inhibitory neurons; most are receptor antagonists. The mixed agonist/antagonist opioids useful for postacute pain should not be used for the chronic pain in end-of-life care. Weak opioids such as codeine can be used initially. However, if they are escalated and fail to relieve pain, strong opioids such as morphine, 5\u201310 mg every 4 h, should be used.

Despite that risk, under no circumstances should adequate pain relief ever be withheld simply because an opioid exhibits potential for misuse or because legislative controls complicate the process of prescribing controlled substances.

The murmur may be soft and difficult to hear unless auscultation is performed with the patient leaning forward at end expiration. This maneuver brings the aortic root closer to the anterior chest wall. Radiation of the murmur may provide a clue to the cause of the AR. With primary valve disease, such as that due to congenital bicuspid disease, prolapse, or endocarditis, the diastolic murmur tends to radiate along the left sternal border, where it is often louder than appreciated in the second right interspace. When AR is caused by aortic root disease, the diastolic murmur may radiate along the right sternal border.

Many patients with significant AR have mid-systolic outflow murmurs even in the absence of valve sclerosis/stenosis, and other findings of AS must be sought. The separate murmurs of AS and AR can occasionally be difficult to distinguish from the continuous murmurs associated with either a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) or ruptured sinus of Valsalva aneurysm. With mixed aortic valve disease, the systolic murmur should end before, and not envelope or extend through, the second heart sound (S2).

In children, adolescents, and young adults with congenital valvular AS, an early ejection sound (click) is usually audible, more often along the left sternal border than at the base. Its presence signifies a flexible, noncalcified bicuspid valve (or one of its variants) and localizes the left ventricular outflow obstruction to the valvular (rather than subor supravalvular) level. Assessment of the volume and rate of rise of the carotid pulse can provide additional information. A small and delayed upstroke (parvus et tardus) is consistent with severe AS.

Diagnosis and management are based on a careful clinical approach augmented by an understanding of the 21 anatomy, physiology, and pharmacology of the nervous system pathways mediating the various headache syndromes. This chapter will focus on the general approach to a patient with headache; migraine and other primary headache disorders are discussed in Chap. 447. A classification system developed by", "Clinical Presentation The patient with NDPH presents with headache on most if not all days, and the patient can clearly, and often vividly, recall the moment of onset. The headache usually begins abruptly, but onset may be more gradual; evolution over 3 days has been proposed as the upper limit for this syndrome. Patients typically recall the exact day and circumstances of the onset of headache; the new, persistent head pain does not remit. The first priority is to distinguish between a primary and a secondary cause of this syndrome. Subarachnoid hemorrhage is the most serious of the secondary causes and must be excluded either by history or appropriate investigation (Chap. 330).

Chapter 8 Disorders of Non-Painful Somatic Sensation Of all the painful states that afflict humans, headache is undoubtedly the most frequent and rivals backache as one of the most common reasons for seeking medical help. In fact, there are so many cases of headache that dedicated headache clinics have been established in many medical centers. In addition to its frequency in general practice, many headaches are caused by medical rather than neurologic diseases and the subject is the legitimate concern of the general physician. Yet there is always the question of intracranial disease so that it is difficult to approach the subject without knowledge of neurology. Why so many pains are centered in the head is a question of some interest. Several explanations come to mind. For", "of the secondary causes and must be excluded either by history or appropriate investigation (Chap. 330). Secondary NDPH \u2022 LOw CSF VOLUME HEAdACHE In these syndromes, head pain is positional: it begins when the patient sits or stands upright and resolves upon reclining. The pain, which is occipitofrontal, is usually a dull ache but may be throbbing. Patients with chronic low CSF volume headache typically present with a history of headache from one day to the next that is generally not present on waking but worsens during the day. Recumbency usually improves the headache within minutes, and it can take only minutes to an hour for the pain to return when the patient resumes an upright position. The most common cause of headache due to persistent low CSF", "a day or two of beginning treatment; failure to do so brings the diagnosis into question. When the sedimentation rate or CRP is elevated, its return to normal, usually over months, is a reliable index of therapeutic response. Whether symptoms or the blood tests are a better guide to reducing the steroid dose is unclear, one should probably be cautious in lowering the medication if the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and CRP remain high.

Most typical is a feeling of occipital pressure that is greatly worsened by lying down, but many patients have\u2014in addition, or only\u2014headaches of migraine or tension type. Indeed, some of them respond", "physician feels the diagnosis is a primary headache disorder, it is worth noting that more than 90% of patients who present to primary care with a complaint of headache will have migraine (Chap. 447). In general, patients who do not have a clear diagnosis, have a primary headache disorder other than migraine or tension-type headache, or are unresponsive to two or more standard therapies for the considered headache type should be considered for referral to a specialist. In a practical sense, the threshold for referral is also determined by the experience of the primary care physician in headache medicine and the availability of secondary care options. John W.

In some individuals, migraine attacks, for unaccountable reasons, may increase in frequency for several months. As many as three or four attacks may occur each week, leaving the scalp on one side continuously tender. When this occurs for more than half of the days in a month, the International Headache Society terms the condition chronic migraine. An even more difficult clinical problem is posed by migraine that lapses into a debilitating condition of severe continuous headache (status migrainosus; defined by the Headache Society as lasting greater than 72 h). The pain is initially unilateral, later more generalized, more or less throbbing, but with a constant superimposed ache and is disabling; vomiting or nausea is common at the outset but abates.

Athletes and runners in general seem to suffer exertional headaches quite often in our experience, and the episodes usually have migrainous features. Indomethacin is usually effective in controlling exertional headaches; this has been confirmed in controlled trials. Useful alternatives are NSAIDs, ergot preparations, and propranolol.

Menarche is a relatively late pubertal event. Females grow only 2 to 5 cm in height", "begin because of increased secretion of adrenal and gonadal steroids at puberty. In general, early-onset acne correlates with the development of severe acne later in puberty. The appearance of comedones in the nasal creases and behind the pinna may be the first indications of impending pubertal development. Hormonal Changes By 10 weeks of gestation, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is present in the hypothalamus, and luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) are present in the pituitary gland (14). Gonadotropin levels are elevated in both female and male fetuses before birth; the levels of FSH are higher in females. At birth, gonadotropin and sex steroid concentrations are still high, but the levels decline during the first several weeks of life and remain low during the prepubertal years. The hypothalamic\u2013pituitary unit", "or time frame should be regarded as abnormal. The pubertal changes, their relationship to one another, and the ages at which they occur are distinctly different in girls than in boys. Although this chapter focuses on girls, changes in boys are considered brie\ufb02y. Tanner Stage In girls, pubertal development typically takes place over 4.5 years (Fig. 29.2). The first sign of puberty is accelerated growth, and breast budding is usually the first recognized pubertal change, followed by the appearance of pubic hair, peak growth velocity, and menarche. The stages initially described by Marshall and Tanner are often used to describe breast and pubic hair development (10). With regard to breast development (Fig. 29.3), Tanner stage 1 refers to the prepubertal state and includes no palpable breast tissue, with", "in stage 1 there is no pubic hair. (Courtesy of J.M. Tanner, MD, Institute of Child Health, Department of Growth and Development, University of London, London, England.) voice, facial hair, and acne indicate the early stages of puberty. See Chapter 174 for discussion of disorders of puberty. Changes Associated with Physical Maturation Tanner stages mark biologic maturation that can be related to specific laboratory value changes and certain physical conditions. The higher hematocrit values in adolescent boys than in adolescent girls are the result of greater androgenic stimulation of the bone marrow and not loss through menstruation. Alkaline phosphatase levels in boys and girls increase during puberty because of rapid bone turnover, especially during the growth spurt. Worsening of mild scoliosis is common in adolescents during their growth", "to comprehend the risks and benefits of evaluation and treatment) All exceptions should be documented clearly in the patient\u2019s health record. *Determined by individual state laws. During the physical examination, a choice between the parent and a chaperone being present needs to be offered. Breast budding under the areola (thelarche) and fine straight pubic hair over the mons pubis (adrenarche or pubarche)are early pubertal changes occurring around 11 years of age (range, 8 to 13 years) (see Chapter 174). These changes mark the sexual maturity rating, or Tanner stage, II of pubertal development (Figs. 67-3 and 67-4). Completion of the Tanner stages should take 4 to 5 years. The peak growth spurt usually Stage 1 The breasts are preadolescent. There is elevation of the papilla only. Figure 67-3", "few, development progresses rapidly. The major complication of sexual precocity is limitation of height. Thus, therapy may be warranted to prevent this consequence. Figure 29.17 Five-year-old girl with development of pubic hair (A) as shown more closely in (B) (precocious adrenarche). Gonadotropin levels were prepubertal, and bone age was appropriate for age. No further development occurred until breast budding at approximately age 9. Figure 29.18 Left: A71/2-year-old girl with Tanner stage 4 pubertal development who began menstruating 1 month earlier. She was 57 inches tall (above the 95th percentile). Luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels were consistent with her development. A large neoplasm that proved to be a hypothalamic hamartoma was present on computed tomography scan. Pubertal development began at about 5 years of age. Figure 29.19 Right:", "background also influence hair growth. In general, dark-haired individuals tend to be more hirsute than blond or fair individuals. Asians and Native Americans have relatively sparse hair in regions sensitive to high androgen levels, whereas people of Mediterranean descent are more hirsute. Historic elements relevant to the assessment of hirsutism include the age at onset and rate of progression of hair growth and associated symptoms or signs (e.g., acne). Depending on the cause, excess hair growth typically is first noted during the second and third decades of life. The growth is usually slow but progressive. Sudden development and rapid progression of hirsutism suggest the possibility of an androgen-secreting neoplasm, in which case virilization also may be present. The age at onset of menstrual cycles (menarche) and the pattern", "used to confirm central precocious puberty. After 100 \u03bcg GnRH, an LH peak of greater than 15 mIU/mL is suggestive of gonadotropin-dependent precocious puberty (68). Perhaps the most difficult decision for the gynecologist is determining how much evaluation is warranted for the young girl brought in by her mother for precocious breast budding only (precocious thelarche) or the appearance of pubic or axillary hair alone (precocious pubarche or adrenarche) (Fig. 29.17). In such cases, it is acceptable to many clinicians to follow the patient at frequent intervals and to proceed with evaluation if there is evidence of pubertal progression. The feasibility of this approach may depend on the concerns of the parents. Premature Thelarche Premature thelarche is unilateral or bilateral breast enlargement without other signs of sexual maturation.", "in girls compared with boys. Precocious Puberty Traditionally, precocious puberty has been defined as the development of secondary sexual characteristics before the age of 8 in girls based on data from Marshall and Tanner in British girls studied in the 1960s. More recent studies led to recommendations that girls be evaluated for precocious puberty if breast development or pubic hair is present at <7 years of age for white girls or <6 years for black girls. Precocious puberty in girls is most often centrally mediated (Table 412-2), resulting from early activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. It is characterized by pulsatile LH secretion (which is initially associated with deep sleep) and an enhanced LH and FSH response to exogenous GnRH (twoto threefold stimulation) (Table 412-3). True precocity is marked", "virilizing tumors develop hirsutism, amenorrhea, infertility, and other signs of masculinization, such as increased muscle mass, deepened voice, and temporal bald-ing, men with these tumors are more difficult to diagnose and, hence, usually present with disease in advanced stages. Chil-dren with virilizing tumors have accelerated growth, premature development of facial and pubic hair, acne, genital enlargement, and deepening of their voice. Feminizing adrenal tumors are less common and occur in men in the third to fifth decades of life. These tumors lead to gynecomastia, impotence, and testicular atrophy. Women with these tumors develop irregular menses or dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Vaginal bleeding may occur in postmenopausal women.

C. Formulate a Microbiologic Diagnosis The history, physical examination, and immediately available laboratory results (eg, Gram stain of urine or sputum) may provide highly specific information. For example, in a young man with urethritis and a Gram-stained smear from the urethral meatus demonstrating intracellular Gram-negative diplococci, the most likely pathogen is Neisseria gonorrhoeae.

The highest incidence in the United States is in 15to 24-year-old females and 20to 24-year-old males, and incidence rates differ by race. The organism causes infection at the site of acquisition, which commonly results in mucopurulent cervicitis and urethritis (see Table 116-1), but infection of the rectum and pharynx can also occur.

Because Gram\u2019s stain is not sensitive for the diagnosis of gonorrhea in women, specimens should be submitted for culture or a nonculture assay (see \u201cLaboratory Diagnosis,\u201d below). Edematous and friable cervical ectopy and endocervical bleeding induced by gentle swabbing are more often seen in chlamydial infection.

About one-third of those with mild reactions to previous exposure react on reexposure. Pretreatment with prednisone and diphenhydramine reduces reaction rates. Persons with a reaction to a high-osmolality contrast media may be given low-osmolality media if later contrast studies are required. The treatment of urticaria or angioedema depends on the severity of the reaction. In severe cases with respiratory or cardiovascular compromise, epinephrine is the mainstay of therapy, but its effect is reduced in patients using beta blockers. Treatment with intravenous systemic glucocorticoids is helpful.

Table 12-3 lists the main causes of optic neuropathy, which are discussed in the following portions of this chapter. Optic Neuritis (See Chap. 35) This inflammatory process causes unilateral acute impairment of vision that may appear in one or both eyes, either simultaneously or successively. It develops in a number of clinical settings, but has a special relationship to multiple sclerosis. The most common situation is one in which an adolescent or young adult woman has a rapid diminution of vision in one eye as though a veil had covered the eye, progressing within hours or days. Pain on movement", "each eye, can be caused by lesions in both optic nerves, the optic chiasm, or the visual pathways posterior to the chiasm. As indicated above, PSVER is especially valuable in proving the existence of active or residual disease of an optic nerve. Patients with previous optic neuritis almost invariably have prolonged latencies. Furthermore, prolongations of PSVER are found in about one-third of multiple sclerosis patients who have had no history or clinical evidence of optic nerve involvement. This acquires significance in that the finding of abnormal PSVER in a patient with a clinically apparent demyelinating lesion elsewhere in the CNS may usually be taken as evidence of multiple sclerosis, as discussed in Chap. 37. A compressive lesion of an optic nerve will have the same effect as a", "It is also appreciated that a visual evoked response is produced by the sudden change of a viewed checkerboard pattern. These responses, produced by rapidly reversing the pattern of black and white squares, are easier to detect and to measure than are flash responses and are more consistent in waveform from one individual to another. The pattern shift stimulus, applied first to one eye and then to the other, can demonstrate conduction delays in the visual pathways of patients who have had disease of the optic nerve\u2014even when there are no residual signs of reduced visual acuity, visual field abnormalities, alterations of the optic nerve head, or changes in pupillary reflexes.

The clinician is well advised to make the diagnosis of MS on the firmest grounds possible and to withhold judgment unless the combination of clinical and laboratory features allows this degree of certainty. In the past, the passage of time was necessary to clarify the situation but presently, it is considered preferable to use MRI and other tests to attempt to establish the diagnosis at the time of the first symptoms. Certainly, the disease is likely when one of the usual syndromes, such as optic neuritis, bilateral brainstem symptoms, or transverse myelitis, occurs in a younger person.

At this time or shortly afterward, other cranial nerves (trigeminal, facial, vagus, and hypoglossal) may also be affected. Ciliary body paralysis with loss of accommodation and blurring of vision but with preserved light reaction usually appears in the second or third week (the opposite of the Argyll Robertson reaction). Rarely, the extraocular muscles are weakened. The cranial nerve signs may clear without further involvement of the nervous system, or a delayed sensorimotor polyneuropathy may develop between the fifth and eighth weeks of the disease.

Aside from papilledema, there is remarkably little to be found on neurologic examination, perhaps slight unilateral or bilateral abducens palsy, fine nystagmus on far lateral gaze, or minor sensory change on the face or trunk. Visual field testing usually shows minor peripheral constriction with enlargement of the blind spots. As the process continues, more severe constriction of the fields, with greater nasal or inferior nasal loss, is found, often inevident to the patient. These issues are elaborated below.

Subclinical PID can be seen with chlamydial salpingooophoritis, with more insidious symptoms that can be confused with the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome. Bacterial vaginosis has been commonly associated with PID (19). Elevated temperature and tachycardia are typical. Abdominal examination may show distention and decreased bowel sounds caused by secondary ileus. Direct and rebound abdominal tenderness with palpation are marked. The most important signs of acute salpingo-oophoritis are cervical motion tenderness and bilateral adnexal tenderness. Evaluation of the pelvis may be difficult because of pain and guarding, but lack of a discrete mass or masses differentiates acute salpingooophoritis from tubo-ovarian abscess or torsion. Right upper", "adolescents have the highest rates of PID (83). Thus, an adolescent who has pelvic pain may have an in\ufb02ammatory mass. Such masses may consist of a tubo-ovarian complex (a mass of matted bowel, tube, and ovary), tubo-ovarian abscess (a mass consisting primarily of an abscess cavity within an anatomically defined structure such as the ovary), pyosalpinx, or, chronically, hydrosalpinx. The diagnosis of PID is primarily a clinical one based on the presence of lower abdominal, pelvic, and adnexal tenderness; cervical motion tenderness; a mucopurulent discharge; and elevated temperature, white blood cell count, or sedimentation rate (see Chapter 18). The risk of PID is clearly associated with that of acquiring STDs, and methods of contraception may either decrease the risk (male latex condoms) or increase it (the intrauterine device", "anesthesia. Adolescent Patients A pelvic examination may be less revealing in an adolescent than in an older woman, particularly if it is the patient\u2019s first examination or if it takes place on an emergency basis. An adolescent who presents with excessive bleeding should have a pelvic examination if she had intercourse, if the results of a pregnancy test are positive, if she has abdominal pain, if she is markedly anemic, or if she is bleeding heavily enough to compromise hemodynamic stability. The pelvic examination occasionally may be deferred in young teenagers who have a classic history of irregular cycles soon after menarche, who have normal hematocrit levels, who deny sexual activity, and who will reliably return for follow-up. A pelvic examination may be deferred in adolescents who present", "but not necessarily, bilateral. Adnexal swelling is palpable in about one-half of women with acute salpingitis, but evaluation of the adnexae in a patient with marked tenderness is not reliable. The initial temperature is >38\u00b0C in only about one-third of patients with acute salpingitis. Laboratory findings include elevation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in 75% of patients with acute salpingitis and elevation of the peripheral white blood cell count in up to 60%. Unlike nontuberculous salpingitis, genital tuberculosis often occurs in older women, many of whom are postmenopausal. Presenting symptoms include abnormal vaginal bleeding, pain (including dysmenorrhea), and infertility. About one-quarter of these women have had adnexal masses. Endometrial biopsy shows tuberculous granulomas and provides optimal specimens for culture. periHepatitis and periappendicitis Pleuritic upper-abdominal pain and tenderness,", "of primary dysmenorrhea usually begins a few hours before or just after the onset of a menstrual period and may last 48 to 72 hours. The pain is similar to labor, with suprapubic cramping, and may be accompanied by lumbosacral backache, pain radiating down the anterior thigh, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and rarely syncopal episodes. The pain of dysmenorrhea is colicky in nature and, unlike abdominal pain that is caused by chemical or infectious peritonitis, is relieved by abdominal massage, counter-pressure, or movement of the body. On examination, the vital signs are normal. The suprapubic region may be tender to palpation. Bowel sounds are normal, and there is no upper abdominal tenderness and no abdominal rebound tenderness. Bimanual examination at the time of the dysmenorrheic episode often reveals uterine", "(see Chapters 8\u201313). Laboratory testing for routine care and high-risk factors is presented in Chapter 8. Physical Examination A thorough gynecologic physical examination is typically performed at the time of the initial visit, on a yearly basis, and as needed throughout the course of treatment (Table 1.6). The extent of the physical examination during the gynecologic visit is often dictated by the patient\u2019s primary concerns and symptoms. For example, for healthy teens without symptoms who are requesting oral contraceptives before the initiation of intercourse, a gynecologic examination is not necessarily required. Some aspects of the examination\u2014such as assessment of vital signs and measurement of height, weight, blood pressure, and calculation of a body mass index\u2014 should be performed routinely during most office visits.

If the edema is generalized, one should first determine if there is serious hypoalbuminemia, e.g., serum albumin <25 g/L. If so, the history, physical examination, urinalysis, and other laboratory data will help evaluate the question of cirrhosis, severe malnutrition, or the nephrotic syndrome as the underlying disorder.

Failure of the heart rate to increase during the positive intrathoracic pressure phase of the Valsalva maneuver points to sympathetic dysfunction, and failure of the rate to slow during the period of blood pressure overshoot points to a parasympathetic disturbance.

In some cases, however, the random inactivation of one X chromosome in each cell-termed lyonization-is skewed, and female carriers may have features of the condition. For example, approximately 10 percent of female carriers of hemophilia A will have factor VIII levels less than 30 percent of normal, and a similar proportion of female hemophilia B carriers have factor IX levels less than 30 percent. Levels below these thresholds confer a greater risk for abnormal bleeding when afected women give birth (Plug, 2006). Indeed, even with higher levels, carriers are reported to be at increased risk for bleeding complications (Olsson, 2014).

In factor 8 or factor 9 deficiency, the aPTT is quite prolonged but should correct to normal when the patient\u2019s plasma is mixed 1:1 with normal plasma. When an abnormal aPTT is obtained, specific factor assays are needed to make a precise diagnosis (see Table 151-2) to determine the appropriate factor replacement therapy.

It is rare among women compared with men, in whom the heterozygous state is responsible for the disease. Heterozygous women have diminished factor VIII levels, but almost invariably, the homozygous state is requisite for hemophilia A. In a few instances, it appears in women spontaneously from a newly mutated gene. Pregnancy-associated acquired hemophilia A from antibodies may result in severe bleeding-related morbidity (Tengborn, 2012). Christmas disease or hemophilia B is caused by severe deiciency of factor IX and has similar genetic and clinical features. he risk of obstetrical bleeding with these is directly related to factor VIII or IX levels. Afected women have a", "of the mothers are carriers of the de novo mutated allele. More than 500 different mutations have been identified in the F8 or F9 genes of patients with hemophilia A or B, respectively. One of the most common hemophilia A mutations results from an inversion of the intron 22 sequence, and it is present in 40% of cases of severe hemophilia A. Advances in molecular diagnosis now permit precise identification of mutations, allowing accurate diagnosis of women carriers of the hemophilia gene in affected families. Clinically, hemophilia A and hemophilia B are indistinguishable.

In the Kaiser system, it is estimated that a 20% decline in hip fracture occurrence was seen with the introduction of what is called a fracture liaison service. This typically involves a health care professional (usually a nurse) whose job is to coordinate follow-up care and education of fracture patients. If the Kaiser experience can be repeated, there would be significant savings of health care dollars, as well as a dramatic drop in hip fracture incidence and a marked improvement in morbidity and mortality among the aging population. Patients presenting with typical osteoporosis-related fractures (certainly hip and spine) can be assumed to have osteoporosis and can be treated appropriately. Patients with osteoporosis by BMD are handled in a similar fashion.

Approximately 11,000 women without a uterus participated in a separate WHI study and were randomized either to estrogen alone or placebo. After an average follow-up of 7 years, there was no increased risk of heart disease or breast cancer in estrogen users. Outcomes were similar to those seen in the estrogen plus progestin arm of WHI with respect to venous thromboembolism, stroke, and osteoporotic fractures; there was no effect on colorectal cancer (52) (see Table 34.5 for a summary of WHI findings).

It is widely recommended for people to adopt an exercise-filled lifestyle, and long-term studies of exercise suggest no consistent association of exercise with OA risk in the majority of persons.

Multiple-gland hyperplasia, as predicted in familial cases, poses more difficult questions of surgical management. Once a diagnosis of hyperplasia is established, all the glands must be identified. Two schemes have been proposed for surgical management. One is to totally remove three glands with partial excision of the fourth gland; care is taken to leave a good blood supply for the remaining gland.

At one center, long-term cures have been achieved with selective embolization or injection of large amounts of contrast material into the end-arterial circulation feeding the parathyroid tumor.

In several centers, a combination of preoperative sestamibi imaging, cervical block anesthesia, minimal surgical incision, and intraoperative PTH measurements has allowed successful outpatient surgical management with a clear-cut cost benefit compared to general anesthesia and more extensive neck surgery. The use of these minimally invasive approaches requires clinical judgment to select patients unlikely to have multiple gland disease (e.g., MEN or secondary hyperparathyroidism). The growing acceptance of the technique and its relative ease for the patient has lowered the threshold for surgery.

It often is difficult to distinguish multiple adenomas from hyperplasia with variable gland size. Hyperplasia may be of the chief cell (more common), mixed, or clear cell type. Patients with hyperplasia may be treated by subtotal para-thyroidectomy or by total parathyroidectomy and autotrans-plantation, with the choice of procedure being determined by rates of recurrence, postoperative hypocalcemia, and failure rates of autotransplanted tissue.

There are many causes of hypoglycemia (Table 420-1). Because hypoglycemia is common in insulinor insulin secretagogue\u2013treated diabetes, it is often reasonable to assume that a clinically suspicious episode is the result of hypoglycemia. On the other hand, because hypoglycemia is rare in the absence of relevant drug-treated diabetes, it is reasonable to conclude that a hypoglycemic disorder is present only in patients in whom Whipple\u2019s triad can be demonstrated.

Reflecting the benignity of repeated minor occurrences, the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial have demonstrated that recurrent hypoglycemic episodes in the course of treatment of diabetes over many years are very well tolerated and do not lead to cognitive decline. A severe and prolonged episode of hypoglycemia may result in permanent impairment of intellectual function as well as other neurologic residua, like those that follow severe anoxia.

This is straightforward if the patient is hypoglycemic when seen. Since endogenous hyperinsulinemic disorders usually, but not invariably, cause fasting hypoglycemia, a diagnostic episode may develop after a relatively short outpatient fast. Serial sampling during an inpatient diagnostic fast of up to 72 h or after a mixed meal is more problematic. An alternative is to give patients a detailed list of the required measurements and ask them to present to an emergency room, with the list, during a symptomatic episode.

The effects of hypoglycemia usually unfold more slowly, over a period of 30 to 60 min, rather than in a few seconds or minutes. The recovery phase and sequelae of the two conditions are quite similar. A large dose of insulin, which produces intense hypoglycemia, even of relatively brief duration (30 to 60 min), is more dangerous than a series of less-severe hypoglycemic episodes from smaller doses of insulin, possibly because the former impairs or exhausts essential enzymes, a condition that cannot then be overcome by large quantities of intravenous glucose.

Early in the drinking period, when blood alcohol levels are rising, symptoms often include talkativeness, a sensation of well-being, and a bright, expansive mood.

Actually, slightly more alcohol is metabolized per hour when the initial concentrations are very high, and repeated ingestion of alcohol may facilitate its metabolism, but these increments are of little clinical significance. In contrast, the rate of oxidation of acetaldehyde does depend on its concentration in the tissues. This fact is of importance in connection with the drug disulfiram (Antabuse), which acts by raising the tissue concentration necessary for the metabolism of a certain amount of acetaldehyde per unit of time.

Physical Examination A thorough gynecologic physical examination is typically performed at the time of the initial visit, on a yearly basis, and as needed throughout the course of treatment (Table 1.6). The extent of the physical examination during the gynecologic visit is often dictated by the patient\u2019s primary concerns and symptoms. For example, for healthy teens without symptoms who are requesting oral contraceptives before the initiation of intercourse, a gynecologic examination is not necessarily required. Some aspects of the examination\u2014such as assessment of vital signs and measurement of height, weight, blood pressure, and calculation of a body mass index\u2014 should be performed routinely during most office visits.

The approach is now referred to as active management of labor. Two of its components-amniotomy and oxytocinhave been widely used, especially in English-speaking countries outside the United States. With this protocol, labor is diagnosed when painful contractions are accompanied by complete cervical efacement, bloody \"show,\" or ruptured membranes. Women with such indings are committed to delivery within 12 hours. Pelvic examination is performed each hour for the next 3 hours, and thereafter at 2-hour intervals. When dilation has not increased by at least 1 cm/hr, amniotomy is performed. Progress is again assessed at 2 hours, and high-dose oxytocin infusion, described in Chapter 26 (p. 509), is started unless dilation of at least 1 cm/hr is attained.

First-stage labor was significantly lengthened with neuraxial analgesia (8.1 versus 6.6 hours) but cesarean delivery rates for dystocia were unafected (9.i1 versus 8.1 percent). In sum, neuraxial analgesia slows the active phase of firststage labor. his currently is empirically corrected by augmentation of uterine contractions. Thus, recommendations of the Consensus Committee regarding protraction disorders are correct. Second, the Consensus Committee (2016) suggests that cesarean deliveries for dystocia are being done before 6 cm cervical dilation. However, there is good reason to believe that all of the Committee's first-stage recommendations are actually already empirically in use but are concurrent with an", "these women were delivered vaginally. As discussed in Chapter 23 (p. 443), these and other studies support the practice of allowing an active-phase arrest of 4 hours (Rouse, 2001). Zhang and coworkers (2002) analyzed labor duration from 4 cm to complete dilatation in 1329 nulliparas at term. They found that before dilation of 7 cm was reached, lack of progress for more than 2 hours was not uncommon in those who delivered vaginally. Alexander and associates (2002) reported that epidural analgesia prolonged active labor by 1 hour compared with duration of the active phase as deined by Friedman (1955).

A second method deines the onset of labor as beginning at the time of admission to the labor unit. In the United States, admission for labor is frequently based on the extent of cervical dilation accompanied by painful contractions. If a woman has intact membranes, then a cervical dilation of3 to 4 cm or greater is presumed to be a reasonably reliable threshold for the diagnosis of labor.

Such a trial should be conducted with very close monitoring of serum sodium as well as urine output, preferably in hospital, because desmopressin will produce hyponatremia in 8\u201324 h if the patient has primary polydipsia. The signs and symptoms of uncomplicated pituitary DI can be eliminated by treatment with desmopressin (DDAVP), a synthetic analogue of AVP (Fig. 404-1).", "hyponatremia or clinically appreciable overhydration is uncommon unless the polydipsia is very severe or the compensatory water diuresis is impaired by a drug or disease that stimulates or mimics the antiduretic effect of endogenous AVP. A rise in plasma osmolarity and sodium produced by fluid deprivation or hypertonic saline infusion increases plasma AVP normally. However, the resultant increase in urine concentration is often subnormal because polyuria per se temporarily reduces the capacity of the kidney to concentrate the urine. Thus, the maximum level of urine osmolarity achieved during fluid deprivation is often indistinguishable from that in patients with partial pituitary or partial nephrogenic DI. Differential Diagnosis When symptoms of urinary frequency, enuresis, nocturia, and/or persistent thirst are present in the absence of glucosuria, the possibility of DI should", "be responsible, with excessive excretion of Na+-Cl\u2013, glucose, and/or urea, then daily solute excretion will be >750\u20131000 mOsm/d (>15 mOsm/kg body water per day) (Fig. 63-6). More commonly, patients with hypernatremia and polyuria will have a predominant water diuresis, with excessive excretion of hypotonic, dilute urine. Adequate differentiation between nephrogenic and central causes of DI requires the measurement of the response in urinary osmolality to DDAVP, combined with measurement of circulating AVP in the setting of hypertonicity. By definition, patients with baseline hypernatremia are hypertonic, with an adequate stimulus for AVP by the posterior pituitary. Therefore, in contrast to polyuric patients with a normal or reduced baseline plasma Na+ concentration and osmolality, a water deprivation test (Chap. 61) is unnecessary in hypernatremia; indeed, water deprivation is absolutely contraindicated", "osmolarity before the latter reaches the normal range, indicating downward resetting of the osmostat.

Pathophysiology Hypodipsia results in a failure to drink enough water to replenish obligatory renal and extrarenal losses. Consequently, plasma osmolarity and sodium rise often to extremely high levels before the disorder is recognized. In most cases, urinary loss of water contributes little, if any, to the dehydration because AVP continues to be secreted in the small amounts necessary to concentrate the urine.

What does the water deprivation test demonstrate? What is the underlying pathophysiology of this patient\u2019s hypernatremic syndrome? This patient became polyuric after admission to the ICU with severe pneumonia, developing significant hypernatremia and acute renal insufficiency.

Diagnosis of diabetes insipidus The diagnosis is suggested by the passage of large quantities of dilute urine accompanied by polydipsia and polyuria lasting throughout the night. The thirst mechanism and drinking usually prevent dehydration and hypovolemia, but if the patient is stuporous or the thirst mechanism is inoperative, severe dehydration and hypernatremia can occur, leading to coma, seizures, and death. In an unresponsive patient careful measurement of fluid output and input are needed to expose the disorder. A low urine osmolality and specific gravity are found in DI, in conjunction with high serum osmolality and sodium values. Osmotic dehydration as a cause of the polydipsia\u2013polyuria syndrome, such as occurs with the glycosuria of diabetes", "is the demonstration that plasma Na+ concentration corrects after hydration with normal saline. Patients with thiazide-associated hyponatremia may also present with higher than expected urine Na+ concentration and other findings suggestive of SIAD; one should defer making a diagnosis of SIAD in these patients until 1\u20132 weeks after discontinuing the thiazide. A urine osmolality <100 mOsm/kg is suggestive of polydipsia; urine osmolality >400 mOsm/kg indicates that AVP excess is playing a more dominant role, whereas intermediate values are more consistent with multifactorial pathophysiology (e.g., AVP excess with a significant component of polydipsia). Patients with hyponatremia due to decreased solute intake (beer potomania) typically have urine Na+ concentration <20 mM and urine osmolality in the range of <100 to the low 200s.

Proof that the patient has a central cause of DI and not nephrogenic unresponsiveness to vasopressin is obtained by injecting 5 U of vasopressin subcutaneously; this will diminish urine output and", "patients with partial pituitary or partial nephrogenic DI. Differential Diagnosis When symptoms of urinary frequency, enuresis, nocturia, and/or persistent thirst are present in the absence of glucosuria, the possibility of DI should be evaluated by collecting a 24-h urine on ad libitum fluid intake. If the volume exceeds 50 mL/kg per day (3500 mL in a 70-kg male) and the osmolarity is below 300 mosmol/L, DI is confirmed and the patient should be evaluated further to determine the type in order to select the appropriate therapy.

Perioperative nutritional support reduces operative morbidity and decreases the length of hospitalization when commenced early in the postoperative course. Patients with either normal nutritional indices or mild or moderate malnutrition, who will be undergoing surgical procedures likely to require a prolonged catabolic period of more than 7 to 10 days, should have enteral or parenteral nutrition instituted in the early postoperative period as soon as the patient is hemodynamically stable.

For some women, hyperemesis can be an indication for elective termination (Poursharif, 2007). In the small percentage of women who continue to have recalcitrant vomiting after intensive therapy, consideration is given for enteral nutrition (p. 1043).

The administration of isotonic fluids in excess of actual needs may result in excess volume expansion.

The average postopera-tive patient who is not receiving nutritional support should lose approximately 0.25 to 0.5 lb/d (0.11 to 0.23 kg/d) from catabo-lism.

In a series by Ramin and colleagues (1995), all 43 afected pregnant women responded to conservative treatment and were hospitalized for a mean of8.5 days.

Is there a discernable anatomic cause for the patient\u2019s symptoms (e.g., abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, heartburn or reflux, nutritional deficiency)? In situations of noninitial weight loss or weight regain, what is the best justification that can be made?

Once the diagnosis is confirmed, acalculous cholecystitis requires urgent inter-vention as rapid deterioration can occur. This should include early broad-spectrum antibiotics and fluid resuscitation. If the patient is stable to undergo an abdominal operation, lapa-roscopic cholecystectomy is the most definitive treatment, and it can be safely performed even in the setting of severe acute inflammation.64 However, if patients are critically ill and unfit for surgery, percutaneous cholecystostomy is the best treatment choice (see Fig. 32-18). About 90% of patients will improve with a percutaneous cholecystostomy tube.

They shift to higher-thannormal glucose levels in people with poorly controlled diabetes, who can experience symptoms of hypoglycemia when their glucose levels decline toward the normal range (pseudohypoglycemia). On the other hand, thresholds shift to lower-than-normal glucose levels in people with recurrent hypoglycemia; e.g., patients with aggressively treated diabetes or an insulinoma have symptoms at glucose levels lower than those that cause symptoms in healthy individuals.

Optimal care involves a team of diabetes professionals, including a physician, a diabetes nurse educator, a dietitian, and a social worker or psychologist. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial established that", "by the patient, and a variable insulin regimen that matches glucose intake and insulin dose. Insulin regimens usually include multiple-component insulin regimens, multiple daily injections (MDIs), or insulin infusion devices (each discussed below). The benefits of intensive diabetes management and improved glycemic control include a reduction in the microvascular complications of DM and a reduction in diabetes-related complications. From a psychological standpoint, the patient experiences greater control over his or her diabetes and often notes an improved sense of well-being, greater flexibility in the timing and content of meals, and the capability to alter insulin dosing with exercise. In addition, intensive diabetes management prior to and during pregnancy reduces the risk of fetal malformations and morbidity. Intensive diabetes management is encouraged in newly diagnosed patients with type 1", "bedtime, and periodically at 2 to 3 am to provide information for adjustment of the regimen. Patients and their families should begin learning the principles of diabetes care as soon as possible. Demonstration of the ability to administer insulin injections and test glucose concentrations using a glucose meter is necessary before discharge, as is knowledge of hypoglycemia management. Meal planning is crucial to control glucose in DM1. Nutrition services must be part of the care delivered to the families from diagnosis. In some patients with new onset of DM1, the beta cell mass has not been completely destroyed. The remaining functionalbeta cells seem to recover function with insulin treatment. When this occurs, exogenous insulin requirements decrease.This is a period of stable blood glucose control, often with nearly normal", "names are sometimes applied to different approaches to diabetes care, such as intensive insulin therapy, intensive glycemic control, and \u201ctight control.\u201d The current chapter, and other sources, uses the term comprehensive diabetes care to emphasize the fact that optimal diabetes therapy involves more than plasma glucose management and medications. Although glycemic control is central to optimal diabetes therapy, comprehensive diabetes care of both type 1 and type 2 DM should also detect and manage DM-specific complications (Chap. 419) and modify risk factors for DM-associated diseases. The key elements of comprehensive diabetes care are summarized in Table 418-1. In addition to the physical aspects of DM, social, family, financial, cultural, and employment-related issues may impact diabetes care.

For example, a cancer patient with painful bony metastases may have additional pain due to nerve damage and may also be depressed. Optimal therapy requires that each of these factors be looked for and treated. Once the evaluation process has been completed and the likely causative and exacerbating factors identified, an explicit treatment plan should be developed. An important part of this process is to identify specific and realistic functional goals for therapy, such as getting a good night\u2019s sleep, being able to go shopping, or returning to work. A multidisciplinary approach that uses medications, counseling, physical therapy, nerve blocks, and even surgery may be required to improve the patient\u2019s quality of life.

When the primary disease is not treatable, the physician should, if time and the circumstances permit, attempt to use the milder measures for pain relief first\u2014for example, nonnarcotic analgesics and antidepressants or antiepileptic drugs before resorting to narcotics, local nerve blocks or contemplating surgical approaches for pain relief. Not all situations allow this graduated approach, and large doses of narcotics may be required early in the course of some illnesses\u2014for example, to treat the pain of visceral and bone cancer.

As time passes, the likelihood of recurrence of the primary cancer diminishes. For many types of cancer, survival for 5 years without recurrence is tantamount to cure. However, important medical problems can occur in patients treated for cancer and must be examined (Chap. 125). Some problems emerge as a consequence of the disease and some as a consequence of the treatment. An understanding of these diseaseand treatment-related problems may help in their detection and management. Despite these concerns, most patients who are cured of cancer return to normal lives. In many ways, the success of cancer therapy depends on the success of the supportive care. Failure to control the", "metastasis, palliative radiotherapy may be advised to control pain or avoid pathologic fractures. This approach is best exemplified in the treatment of isolated bone metastases, chest wall recurrences, brain metastases, and spinal cord compression. Systemic disease may be controlled by hormonal or cytotoxic therapy. Because the quality of life during an endocrine-induced remission is usually superior to one following cytotoxic chemotherapy, it is preferable to try endocrine manipulation first. As many as one-third of patients with disseminated disease respond favorably to either functional end-organ ablation (ovary, pituitary, adrenal glands) or administration of drugs that block hormonal function. For patients with estrogen receptor\u2013positive tumors, this response rate may be as high as 60%. Because only 5% to 10% of women with estrogen receptor\u2013negative cancers respond to endocrine treatment, they", "may still result in good limb and bladder function. Epidural growths of carcinoma and lymphoma have been typically managed by administration of high to moderate doses of corticosteroids and radiation of the region of tumor although surgical options exist and provide faster decompression and the opportunity for stabilization of the spinal column. The choice of surgery or stereotactic radiation is complex, partly stylistic, and dependent on the likelihood of survival as noted below, and possibly by the radiosensitivity of the tumor and as summarized by Ropper and Ropper. Either treatment may be supplemented by endocrine therapy (for carcinoma of breast and prostate), and of antineoplastic drugs (for certain lymphomas and myelomas.

When gonadal dysgenesis occurs in 46,XY individuals, it is sometimes termed Swyer syndrome. Surgical extirpation is warranted in individuals with a 46,XY karyotype to prevent development of germ cell neoplasms. Both 46,XX and 46,XY forms of gonadal dysgenesis benefit from exogenous estrogen and are potential candidates for donor oocytes. In early gonadal failure, the ovaries apparently develop normally but contain no oocytes by the expected age of puberty.

Boys grow an average of 28 cm during the growth spurt, in comparison to a mean of 25 cm for girls. Adult men eventually are an average of 13 cm taller than adult women because they are taller at the onset of the growth spurt. Hormonal control of the pubertal growth spurt is complex. Growth hormone (GH), insulinlike growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and gonadal steroids play major roles. Adrenal androgens appear to be less important.

This quick calculation can be of assistance in evaluating individuals with delayed or precocious pubertal development and those with short stature. Several changes in body composition occur during pubertal development. Although lean body mass, skeletal mass, and body fat are equal in prepubertal boys and girls, by maturity, men have 1.5 times the lean body mass and almost 1.5 times the skeletal mass of women, whereas women have twice as much body fat as men (1). The changes in body contour in girls, with accumulation of fat at the thighs, hips, and buttocks, occur during the pubertal growth spurt.

More recently, administration of antenatal corticosteroids to women at risk for late-preterm delivery (34 to 36 weeks' gestation) was found to significantly reduce the rate of neonatal respiratory complications (Gyami-Bannerman, 2016). Amniocentesis to Assess Fetal Lung Maturity In some instances, when gestational age is uncertain, knowledge of fetal lung maturity may inluence plans for delivery. One example is the woman with a prior classical cesarean delivery in whom repeat operation is planned and gestational age cannot be confirmed. Several tests are used to ensure fetal pulmonary maturity by analysis of amnionic fluid obtained by sonographically guided amniocentesis. At Parkland Hospital, we still find an occasional indication for such testing, however, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2017 a, b)", "and again in the third trimester. Treatment is given for gonorrhea and simultaneously for possible coexisting chlamydial infection (Chap. 65, p. 1240). Test of cure is also recommended following treatment. Many factors can adversely afect maternal and fetal well-being. Some are evident at conception, but many become apparent during the course of pregnancy. The designation of \"high-risk pregnancy\" is overly vague for an individual woman and probably is best avoided if a more specific diagnosis can be assigned. TABLE 9-3.

For example, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that reporting include all fetuses and neonates born weighing at minimum 500 g, whether alive or dead. But, not all states follow this recommendation. Speciically, 28 states stipulate that fetal deaths beginning at 20 weeks' gestation should be recorded as such; eight states report all products of conception as fetal deaths; and still others use a minimum birthweight", "at 26 to 27 weeks' gestation for daily fetal surveillance. However, in 44 women managed as outpatients and admitted only for obstetrical indications, there were 13 stillbirths. Because of this report, women with monoamnionic twins are recommended to undergo 1 hour of daily fetal heart rate monitoring, either as an outpatient or inpatient, beginning at 26 to 28 weeks' gestation. With initial testing, a course of betamethasone is given to promote pulmonary maturation (Chap. 42, p. 823). If fetal testing remains reassuring and no other intervening indications arise, cesarean delivery is performed at 32 to 34 weeks. A second course of betamethasone can be given before this (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 2016). his management scheme is used at Parkland Hospital and resulted in the successful 34-week", "studied the maturation of normal fetal breathing using color low and spectral Doppler analysis of nasal fluid low as an index of lung function. hey suggested that fetal respiratory rate declined in conjunction with increased respiratory volume at 33 to 36 weeks and coincidental with lung maturation. Many investigators have examined fetal breathing movements using sonography to determine whether chest wall movements might reflect fetal health. Several variables in addition to hypoxia were found to afect fetal respiratory movements. These included hypoglycemia, sound stimuli, cigarette smoking, amniocentesis, impending preterm labor, gestational age, the fetal heart rate itself, and labor-during which it is normal for respiration to cease. Because fetal breathing movements are episodic, interpretation of fetal health when respirations are absent may be tenuous.

Power can range from 0 to 1, and as power increases, there is decreasing probability of making a type II error. Power is related to three main factors: (a) the statistical significance criterion of the study, (b) the magnitude of the effect of interest, and (c) the sample size used to detect the effect.

This p value may be adjusted downward if multiple associations are being tested and the chances of false discovery are high.

This problem is now amplified by the wide array of medical information available to patients through various sources such as the Internet. The patient who is given to highly circumstantial and rambling accounts can be kept on the subject of his illness by directive questions that draw out essential points.

In addition to the pains caused by the more common and readily recognized diseases of each organ system, there remain a significant number of chronic pains that fall into one of four categories: (1) pain from an obscure medical disease, the nature of which has not yet been disclosed by diagnostic procedures; (2) pain associated with disease of the central or peripheral nervous system (i.e., neurogenic, or neuropathic pain); (3) pain", "slowly moves peripherally.

Although not always made explicit, comparisons of NNT estimates from different studies should account for the duration of follow-up used to create each estimate.

Case-control epidemiologic studies utilize populations of patients that have displayed the end point under study and ask whether they have been exposed or not exposed to the drugs in question. Such epidemiologic studies add weight to conjectures but cannot control all confounding variables and therefore cannot conclusively prove cause and effect. Meta-analyses utilize rigorous evaluation and grouping of sim-ilar studies to increase the number of subjects studied and hence the statistical power of results obtained in multiple published studies.

The importance of careful and complete reporting of toxicity by physicians after marketing begins can be appreciated by noting that many important drug-induced effects have an incidence of 1 in 10,000 or less and that some adverse effects may become apparent only after chronic dosing. The sample size required to disclose drug-induced events or toxicities is very large for such rare events. For example, several hundred thousand patients may have to be exposed before the first case is observed of a toxicity that occurs with an average incidence of 1 in 10,000.

Clinicians also should examine what absolute risk reduction (ARR) can be expected from the therapy. A useful summary metric of absolute treatment benefit is the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one adverse outcome event (e.g., death, stroke). NNT is simply 1/ARR. For example, if a hypothetical therapy reduced mortality rates over a 5-year follow-up by 33% (the relative treatment benefit) from 12% (control arm) to 8% (treatment arm), the ARR would be 12% \u2013 8% = 4%, and the NNT would be 1/0.04, or 25.

Strengths of cohort studies include the ability to obtain both attributable and relative risks because the occurrence of the outcome is being compared in two groups (see the section on Presenting and Understanding the Results of Analytic Studies). However, only associations can be established, not causality.

Any of these findings man-dates immediate surgical intervention, which should consist of incision and direct visualization of potentially infected tissue (including deep soft tissue, fascia, and underlying muscle) and radical resection of affected areas. Radiologic studies should not be undertaken in patients in whom the diagnosis seriously is con-sidered, as they delay surgical intervention and frequently pro-vide confusing information.

However, the characteristics of the pain are pivotal in formulating an initial clinical impression and assessing the likelihood of a serious cardiopulmonary process (Table 19-1), including acs in particular (Fig. 19-2).

Chronic infectious rhinosinusitis, or sinusitis, should be suspected if there is mucopurulent nasal discharge with symptoms that persist beyond 10 days (see Chapter 104). Classic signs of acute sinusitis in older children include facial tenderness, tooth pain, headache, and fever. Classic signs are usually not present in young children who may present with postnasal drainage with cough, throat clearing, halitosis, and rhinorrhea. The character of the nasal secretions with infectious rhinitis varies from purulent to minimal or absent. Coexistence", "In the elderly, influenza may have a relatively subtle presentation. Typical features such as sore throat, myalgia, and even fever may be absent, and general symptoms such as anorexia, malaise, weakness, and dizziness may predominate.

Early in the illness, the patient appears flushed, and the skin is hot and dry, although diaphoresis and mottled extremities are sometimes evident, particularly in older patients. Examination of the pharynx may yield surprisingly unremarkable results despite a severe sore throat, but injection of the mucous membranes and postnasal discharge are apparent in some cases.

Virtually all women with oligohydramnios delivered before 25 weeks, whereas 85 percent with adequate amnionic luid volume were delivered in the third trimester. Carroll and coworkers (1995) observed no cases of pulmonary hypoplasia in fetuses born after membrane rupture at 24 weeks or beyond.

An average child has three to six common colds per year, with the most affected being younger children and children attending day care. Infection is suggested by the presence of sore throat, fever, and poor appetite, especially with a history of exposure to others with colds. Chronic infectious rhinosinusitis, or sinusitis, should be suspected if there is mucopurulent nasal discharge with symptoms that persist beyond 10 days (see Chapter 104). Classic signs of acute sinusitis in older children include facial tenderness, tooth pain, headache, and fever.

Initial episodes of sinusitis do not require imaging studies; however, when persistent infections occur, studies and referral are indicated. Computed tomography of the sinuses demonstrated that 90% of patients with colds have radiological evidence of sinus disease that usually will resolve in 2 to 3 weeks.

The diagnosis is made by physical examination showing an enlarged hemithorax with no breath sounds, hyperresonance to percussion, and shift of the mediastinum to the contralateral side.

Also, detailed information regarding previous pregnancies is essential as many obstetrical complications tend to recur in subsequent pregnancies. The menstrual and contraceptive histories are also important. Gestational or menstrual age is the number of weeks since the onset of the last menstrual period in women with menstrual cycles lasting 28 to 30 days.

Physical Examination Routine pelvic examination is an essential component of general medical care; this is not the case with women who seek care for sexual concerns.

Adolescents typically wait many months after initiating sexual activity to seek medical contraception. 3. At least 80% of adolescent pregnancies are unintended (94). 4. Approximately one-quarter of adolescent pregnancies end in abortion (95). 5. Approximately one in three young women will experience a pregnancy before age 20 (96).

Following recovery from a complete resection, patients should be observed carefully for 5 years by semiannual physical examinations and blood chemistry measurements. If a complete colonoscopy was not performed preoperatively, it should be carried out within the first several postoperative months. Some authorities favor measuring plasma CEA levels at 3-month intervals because of the sensitivity of this test as a marker for otherwise undetectable tumor recurrence.

There seems to be no indication for dissection of the pelvic nodes in the absence of positive groin nodes, and good results were reported with hemivulvectomy or radical local excision for the primary tumor (199).

Postoperative radiation to the vulva decreased the likelihood of local recurrence from 27% (6 of 22 patients) to 7% (1 of 14 patients) (199).

The major causes of delayed puberty include anatomic genital tract abnormalities and hypo-and hypergonadotropic amenorrhea. When pubertal development occurs asynchronously with development of breasts in the absence of significant pubic and axillary hair, the diagnosis is usually androgen insensitivity. The most common cause of precocious puberty is constitutional (idiopathic), but more serious causes must be ruled out and therapy geared toward optimizing adult height. The most common cause of heterosexual development at the expected age of puberty is polycystic ovary syndrome. Puberty is the period during which secondary sexual characteristics develop and the capability of sexual reproduction is attained.

When no secondary sexual development is present after the upper age limits of normal pubertal development, serum gonadotropin levels should be obtained to determine whether the patient has a hypogonadotropic or hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (see Table 174-2).

In some patients, the defect in the androgen receptor is not complete and virilization occurs. 3. An absent endometrium is an out\ufb02ow tract abnormality that cannot be diagnosed by physical examination in a patient with primary amenorrhea.

Patients have a blind vaginal pouch and scant or absent axillary and pubic hair. These patients experience abundant breast development at puberty; however, the nipples are immature and the areolae are pale.

Diagnosis The diagnostic workup includes a complete history and physical examination, careful speculum examination and palpation of the vagina, and bimanual pelvic and rectal examinations. It is important to rotate the speculum to obtain a careful view of the entire vagina because posterior wall lesions frequently occur and may be overlooked. In early squamous cell lesions, the diagnosis is often suggested by an abnormal Pap test result; however, this is not true for clear cell adenocarcinomas, which are characterized by submucosal growth.

Invasive tumors of the cervix, vagina, and vulva are usually evident on examination, and any tumors discovered should be biopsied. Traumatic bleeding from an atrophic vagina may account for up to 15% of all causes of postmenopausal vaginal bleeding.

The developing tumor may be missed during initial inspection because of obscured visualization caused by the blades of the speculum (214).

Other less common symptoms are vaginal discharge, abdominal or pelvic pain, weight loss, and passage of tissue from the vagina. The duration of symptoms usually is only a few months. On physical examination, uterine enlargement is present in 50% to 95% of patients, and a polypoid mass may be seen within or protruding from the endocervical canal in up to 50% of patients.

Most women recognize the importance of this symptom and seek medical consultation within 3 months. Some women experience pelvic pressure or discomfort indicative of uterine enlargement or extrauterine disease spread. Bleeding may not have occurred because of cervical stenosis, especially in older patients, and may be associated with hematometra or pyometra, causing a purulent vaginal discharge.

At the 1-year mark, graft survival is higher for living-donor recipients, most likely because those grafts are not subject to as much ischemic injury. The more effective drugs now in use for immunosuppression have almost equalized the risk of graft rejection in all patients for the first year. At 5 and 10 years, however, there has been a steeper decline in survival of those with deceased-donor kidneys. There are few absolute contraindications to renal transplantation.

Therapy with these agents has been especially effective in reversing acute rejection in the posttransplantation period and is the standard treatment for acute rejection that fails to respond to methylprednisolone boluses. Available data support the use of thymoglobulin induction to delay calcineurin inhibitor use and its attendant nephrotoxicity.

During the rapid ejection phase of systole, the volume of blood introduced into the arterial system exceeds the volume that exits the system through the arterioles. Arterial pressure and volume therefore peak; the peak arterial pressure is systolic pressure. During the remainder of the cardiac cycle (i.e., ventricular diastole), exceeds cardiac ejection.

These relationships are expressed mathematically as Equation 17.15 where dVa/dt is the change in arterial blood volume per unit of time. If Qh exceeds Qr, arterial volume increases, the arterial walls are stretched further, and pressure rises. The converse happens when Qr exceeds Qh. When Qh equals Qr, Pa remains constant. Thus increases in cardiac output raise Pa, as do increases in peripheral resistance. Conversely, decreases in cardiac output or peripheral resistance decrease Pa. Arterial pulse pressure is systolic pressure minus diastolic pressure. It is principally a function of just one physiological factor, stroke volume, which determines the change in arterial blood volume (a physical factor) during ventricular systole.

In the cardiovascular system, the cardiac output increment required by mild or moderate exercise is successfully provided until at least age 75 (in individuals without obvious cardiac disease), but the increase is the result primarily of increased stroke volume in the elderly and not tachycardia, as in young adults. Average blood pressure goes up with age (in most Western countries), but the incidence of symptomatic orthostatic hypotension also increases markedly. It is thus particularly important to check for orthostatic hypotension (>20 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure on standing) on every visit.

Because of the difference in arterial and venous compliance, Pa rises at a rate 19 times faster than the rate at which Pv falls. The resultant arteriovenous pressure gradient causes blood to flow through the peripheral resistance vessels. If the heart maintains a constant output of 1 L/minute, Pa continues to rise and Pv continues to fall until the pressure gradient becomes 20 mm Hg.

As a result, the diagnosis is mainly based on clinical findings.

Approximately 70% to 85% of cases are familial, and the rest are sporadic, arising from de novo FBN1 mutations in the germ cells of parents. Although many of the abnormalities in Marfan syndrome can be explained on the basis of structural failure of connective tissues, some, such as overgrowth of bones, are difficult to relate to simple loss of fibrillin. It is now evident that loss of microfibrils gives rise to abnormal and excessive activation of transforming growth factor-\u03b2", "both copies of a gene pair located on a non-sex chromosome have a mutation (Tables 47-4, 47-5).

This calm attitude toward a turbulent illness and seemingly disabling physical signs is so common that it has been singled out as an important characteristic of hysteria, la belle indifference. Other patients, however, are obviously tense and anxious and report frank anxiety attacks. Emotional reactions are superficial and scenes that are disturbing to others are quickly forgotten. Claims of early life sexual or physical abuse are common and often prove to be true, or sometimes are not valid; when present, they probably play a role in", "On record are numerous studies in which patients with an initial diagnosis of hysteria by general physicians were followed for many years.

This emphasizes that the original clinical diagnosis of hysteria is sometimes erroneous, although numerous other surveys emphasize the opposite, as noted below. When the diagnostic criteria in these cases are closely analyzed, it becomes apparent that the diagnosis was made solely by the \u201cdiscrepancy method\u201d\u2014that is, the patient\u2019s symptoms or signs were not deemed to be credible manifestations of disease, based mainly on the clinical experience of the examiner.

This kind of history is laborious and time-consuming, making it not especially popular, even though a reasonably accurate diagnosis can be made on the basis of the history alone in the majority of cases. In cases of acute abdominal pain, a diagnosis is readily established in most instances, whereas success is not so frequent in patients with chronic pain. IBS is one of the most common causes of abdominal pain and must always be kept in mind (Chap. 352). The location of the pain can assist in narrowing the differential diagnosis (Table 20-3); however, the chronological sequence of events in the patient\u2019s history is often more important than the pain\u2019s location.

History After the chief complaint and characteristics of the present illness are ascertained, the medical history of the patient should be obtained.

Causes are categorized into pretesticular (nonobstructive), testicular (nonobstructive), and posttesticular (includes obstructive and nonobstructive) etiologies, but in some cases the condition is idiopathic (47,86). Pretesticular azoospermia is relatively rare and results from gonadotropin deficiency, which leads to loss of spermatogenesis.

However, the etiology is not ascertained in up to one-half of men with suspected male factor infertility. The key initial diagnostic test is a semen analysis. Testosterone levels should be measured if the sperm count is low on repeated examination or if there is clinical evidence of hypogonadism.

It presents a time for the physician to emphasize the emotional support available to the couple as they proceed with the diagnostic evaluation and suggested treatments. In some cases, referral to a trained social worker or psychologist may be beneficial. The physical examination of the woman should be thorough, with particular attention given to height, weight, body habitus, hair distribution, thyroid gland, and pelvic examination. Referral of the male partner to a urologist for examination often is beneficial if historic information or subsequent evaluation suggests an abnormality.

If abnormalities in the semen are detected, further evaluation of the male partner by a urologist is indicated to diagnose the defect. Table 32.4 lists the differential diagnoses for male factor infertility (53). Several groups have attempted to assess the distribution of male infertility diagnoses; two such distributions are shown in Table 32.5 (54,55). The first is the result of a WHO study of 7,057 men with complete diagnoses based on the WHO standard investigation of the infertile couple (54).

Although libido and the overall frequency of sexual acts are decreased in androgen-deficient men, young hypogonadal men may achieve erections in response to visual erotic stimuli. Men with acquired androgen deficiency often report decreased energy and increased irritability. The physical examination should focus on secondary sex characteristics such as hair growth, gynecomastia, testicular volume, prostate, and height and body proportions.

The second distribution is the result of a study of 425 subfertile male patients (54). Although the two studies represent different populations (one is from a study of couples, the other from a urologic practice) and differ in their distribution of male infertility diagnoses, idiopathic male factor and varicocele predominate. Other anatomic and endocrine causes occur less frequently. Same sex female couples or single women without a male partner who desire pregnancy may be considered as part of this category.

During the rapid ejection phase of systole, the volume of blood introduced into the arterial system exceeds the volume that exits the system through the arterioles. Arterial pressure and volume therefore peak; the peak arterial pressure is systolic pressure. During the remainder of the cardiac cycle (i.e., ventricular diastole), exceeds cardiac ejection.

Resistant hypertension may be related to \u201cpseudoresistance\u201d (high office blood pressures and lower home blood pressures), nonadherence to therapy, identifiable causes of hypertension (including obesity and excessive alcohol intake), and the use of any of a number of nonprescription and prescription drugs (Table 298-3).

Bilateral cingulectomies performed in the past on psychotic and anxious patients result in an overall diminution of emotional reactions (Ballantine et al; Brown).

In a very few such cases, in which aggression has resulted in serious injury to others (or homicide), depth electrodes placed in the amygdaloid nuclear complex have recorded what could be construed as seizure discharges.

Phase III Trials In phase III trials, the experimental study drug or treatment is given to large groups of people (1,000\u20133,000) to confirm its effectiveness, monitor side effects, compare it to commonly used treatments, and collect information that will allow the experimental drug or treatment to be used safely.

In clinical trials it is important for the investigator to address the beta error, even in the design stage of the study. Study planners should calculate the power (or 1\u2013the beta error) that their study would have to detect an association, given assumptions made about the differences expected between treatments, and design the study size accordingly.

Symptoms that accompany vertigo may be helpful in distinguishing peripheral vestibular lesions from central causes. Unilateral hearing loss and other aural symptoms (ear pain, pressure, fullness) typically point to a peripheral cause. Because the auditory pathways quickly become bilateral upon entering the brainstem, central lesions are unlikely to cause unilateral hearing loss, unless the lesion lies near the root entry zone of the auditory nerve.

M\u00e9ni\u00e8re Disease and Other Forms of Labyrinthine Vertigo Labyrinthine disorders are the most common causes of true vertigo. M\u00e9ni\u00e8re disease is characterized by paroxysmal attacks of vertigo associated with fluctuating tinnitus and deafness. One or the other of the latter two symptoms may be absent during the initial attacks of vertigo, but invariably they assert themselves as the disease progresses and increase in severity during acute attacks. M\u00e9ni\u00e8re disease affects the sexes about equally and has its onset most frequently in the fifth decade of life, although it may begin earlier or later. Cases of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re disease usually occur as a sporadic trait, but hereditary forms, both autosomal dominant and recessive, have been described (see reviews by Konigsmark). The main pathologic changes", "a progressive increase in deafness. The attacks vary considerably in frequency and severity. They may recur several times weekly for many weeks on end, or there may be remissions of several years\u2019 duration. Frequently recurring attacks may give rise to a mild chronic state of disequilibrium and a reluctance to move the head or to turn quickly. With milder forms of the disease, the patient may complain more of head discomfort and of difficulty in concentrating than of vertigo and then may be considered to signify anxiety. Symptoms of anxiety are common in patients with M\u00e9ni\u00e8re disease, particularly in those with frequent severe attacks. A small proportion of patients with M\u00e9ni\u00e8re disease experience sudden, violent falling attacks.

The relationship of migraine to vertigo was mentioned earlier. This refers to otherwise mundane migraine in which the vertigo is perhaps an aura, or to episodes of paroxysmal vertigo in adults that are considered to be migraine equivalents. In addition, attacks of vertigo followed by an intense unilateral and often suboccipital headache and vomiting are the characteristic features of basilar artery migraine. The prodromal visual symptoms take the form of blindness or of photopsia that occupies all of the visual fields. Between headaches, tests of cochlear and vestibular function in these patients are normal. Some authorities have stated that most cases of recurrent vertigo without hearing loss over many years can be attributed to migraine and not to M\u00e9ni\u00e8re", "of the falling attack, although some patients become aware of these symptoms after falling. The attacks may occur early or late in the course of the disease. Typically, several attacks occur over a period of a year or less and remit spontaneously (Baloh et al). An initial attack must be distinguished from other types of drop attacks, but the occurrence of the more typical vertiginous attacks of M\u00e9ni\u00e8re disease, with deafness and tinnitus, clarifies the diagnosis. The hearing loss in M\u00e9ni\u00e8re disease usually precedes the first attack of vertigo but it may appear later.

This disorder was first described by B\u00e1r\u00e1ny (1921) but Dix and Hallpike emphasized its benign nature and were responsible for its further characterization, particularly the discrete positional movements that provoke it.

Often a single treatment sequence suffices to terminate a period of positional vertigo (approximately 80 percent respond), but a second sequence carried out immediately after the first probably gains another small group who derive benefit.

Food and liquids with particulate matter should be withheld during active labor and delivery. Gastric emptying time is remarkably prolonged once labor is established and analgesics are administered. As a consequence, ingested food and most medications remain in the stomach and are not absorbed. Instead, they may be vomited and aspirated (Chap. 25, p. 499). According to the American Academy of Pediatrics", "nervous system. The examination should proceed with an assessment of vital signs, particularly heart rate (normal rate, 120 to 160 beats/min); respiratory rate (normal rate, 30 to 60 breaths/min); temperature (usually done per rectum and later as an axillary measurement); and blood pressure (often reserved for sick infants). Length, weight, and head circumference should be measured and plotted on growth curves to determine whether growth is normal, accelerated, or retarded for the specific gestational age.

Rotator cuff tendinitis or tear is a very common cause of shoulder pain. Nearly 30 percent of the elderly will have shoulder pain, with rotator cuff tendinitis or tear as the primary cause. The rotator cuff is formed by four tendons that attach the scapula to the proximal humerus (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis tendons).

A subset of patients is refractory and requires ultrasound-guided percutaneous needle aspiration and lavage or surgery. Bicipital tendinitis, or tenosynovitis, is produced by friction on the tendon of the long head of the biceps as it passes through the bicipital groove. When the inflammation is acute, patients experience anterior shoulder pain that radiates down the biceps into the forearm. Abduction and external rotation of the arm are painful and limited. The bicipital groove is very tender to palpation.

Manual inspection of the periarticular structures will often provide important diagnostic information. Glenohumeral involvement is best detected by placing the thumb over the glenohumeral joint just medial and inferior to the coracoid process and applying pressure anteriorly while internally and externally rotating the humeral head. Pain localized to this region is indicative of glenohumeral pathology.

The intensity of left-sided murmurs either remains constant or decreases with inspiration.

The current approach to vaccination against influenza is to use a killed virus vaccine that is reformulated annually on the basis of the prevalent strains of virus. The vaccine is moderately effective, reducing mortality in elderly people and illness in healthy adults. The ideal influenza vaccine would be an attenuated live organism that matched the prevalent virus strain.

A successful vaccine must possess several features in addition to its ability to provoke a protective immune response (Fig. 16.23). First, it must be safe. Vaccines must be given to huge numbers of people, relatively few of whom are likely to die of, or sometimes even catch, the disease that the vaccine is designed to prevent. This means that even a low level of toxicity is unacceptable. Second, the vaccine must be able to produce protective immunity in a very high proportion of the", "as a vaccine. The mutations in the virulence gene are usually large, so that it is very difficult for the virus to revert to the wild type. deliberately attenuated virus can then be used as a vaccine (Fig. 16.25). The advantage of this approach is that mutations can be engineered so that reversion to wild type is virtually impossible. Such an approach might be useful in developing live influenza vaccines. As described in Chapter 13, the influenza virus can reinfect the same host several times, because it undergoes antigenic shift and thus predominantly escapes the original immune response. A weak protection conferred by previous infections with a different subtype of influenza is observed in adults, but not in children, and is called heterosubtypic immunity.

The vaccine is generated by reassortment between currently circulating strains of influenza A and B viruses and a cold-adapted, attenuated master strain.

Live attenuated vaccine is approved for use in healthy nonpregnant persons 2\u201349 years of age. Since 1975, influenza vaccines have been trivalent\u2014i.e., they have contained two influenza A subtypes (H3N2 and H1N1) and one influenza B component. However, two antigenically distinct lineages of influenza B virus have circulated since the 1980s, and a quadrivalent vaccine that includes both B lineages", "which would stimulate protective immunity but not cause disease. This approach continues into the present with the design of genetically attenuated pathogens in which desirable mutations are introduced into the organism by recombinant DNA technologies. This idea is being applied to important pathogens, such as malaria, for which vaccines are currently unavailable, and may be important in the future for designing vaccines for influenza and HIV. The second approach was the development of vaccines based on killed organisms and, subsequently, on purified components of organisms that would be as effective as live whole organisms. Killed vaccines were desirable because any live vaccine, including vaccinia, can cause lethal systemic infection in immunosuppressed people.

Universal childhood vaccination with conjugate vaccines for H. influenzae type b and S. pneumoniae has greatly diminished the incidence of these pneumonias. The severity of RSV infections can be reduced by use of palivizumab in high-risk patients (see Chapter 109).

There are substantial difficulties in the development of live attenuated vaccines against HIV, not least the worry of recombination between vaccine strains and wildtype viruses that would lead to a reversion to virulence. An alternative approach is the use of other viruses, such as vaccinia or adenovirus, to deliver and express HIV genes that elicit Band Tcell responses against HIV antigens.

However, vaccination can be followed by the replacement of vaccine serotypes with nonvaccine serotypes, as was seen with serotypes 19A and 35B after introduction of the original 7-valent conjugate vaccine. PCV13 now is also recommended for the elderly and for younger immunocompromised patients. Because of an increased risk of pneumococcal infection, even among patients without obstructive lung disease, smokers should be strongly encouraged to stop smoking. Two forms of influenza vaccine are available: intramuscular inactivated vaccine and intranasal live-attenuated cold-adapted vaccine. The latter is contraindicated in immunocompromised patients. In the event of an influenza outbreak, unprotected patients at risk from complications should be vaccinated immediately and given chemoprophylaxis with either oseltamivir or zanamivir for 2 weeks\u2014i.e., until vaccine-induced antibody levels are sufficiently high.

A guidewire is traversed through the thrombus, and a catheter is placed within the thrombus. Typically, tissue plasminogen activator is admin-istered through a multi\u2013side-hole infusion catheter. Various catheter-based mechanical techniques may also be employed to speed thrombus removal. Heparin is administered concurrently with the thrombolytic infusion. After completion of thrombo-lytic", "the patient has stood, and the varicose veins are filled. The patient is then instructed to walk for 5 min. A patent deep venous system and competent perforating veins enable the superficial veins below the tourniquet to collapse. Deep venous obstruction is likely to be present if the superficial veins distend further with walking. Differential Diagnosis The duration of leg edema helps to distinguish chronic venous insufficiency from acute deep vein thrombosis. Lymphedema, as discussed later in this chapter, is often confused with chronic venous insufficiency, and both may occur together. Other disorders that cause leg swelling should be considered and excluded when evaluating a patient with presumed venous insufficiency. Bilateral leg swelling occurs in patients with congestive heart failure, hypoalbuminemia secondary to nephrotic syndrome or severe hepatic", "is 87% (normal > 90%).

She had been in her usual state of health until 2 days prior when she noted that her left leg was swollen and red. Her only medication was oral contraceptives.

These anastomose with the superior, superficial, and deep epigastric venous systems to drain into the internal thoracic veins, which in turn drain into the brachiocephalic veins and the superior vena cava. After the initial inferior vena cava thrombosis, the veins of the anterior abdominal wall and other collateral pathways hypertrophy to accommodate the increase in blood flow. A 52-year-old woman visited her family physician with complaints of increasing lethargy and vomiting.

Early in the course of DVT development, venous thrombosis is thought to begin in an area of relative stasis, such as a soleal sinus vein or immediately downstream of the cusps of a venous valve in an axial calf vein. Isolated proxi-mal DVT without tibial vein thrombosis is unusual. Early in the course of a DVT, there may be no or few clinical findings such as pain or swelling. Even extensive DVT may sometimes be present without signs or symptoms if the patient is nonambula-tory or bedbound.

In addition,", "numbness and tingling, weakness of grip, discoloration of the fingers, and even gangrene or ulcers of the fingertips.If acute in onset, proximal occlusions may be extracted with a balloon catheter or, sometimes, under direct vision via an arteriotomy. Very distal embolism may require infusion of thrombolytics to dissolve clots and allow reperfusion. Large-vessel acute embolism and reperfusion may result in edema and compartment syndrome, requiring fasciotomy. A high index of suspicion must be maintained.For the more common scenario of chronic, progres-sive occlusion, the involved segment of ulnar artery should be resected. There is disagreement in the literature regarding whether simple ligation and excision is sufficient for patients with sufficient distal flow or if all patients should undergo vas-cular reconstruction.108 The authors\u2019 personal preference is to reconstruct all patients.Systemic", "with such a diagnosis?

Importantly, two new forms of treatment aimed at increasing CFTR protein function in certain CFTR variants have been approved. For example, a group of agents known as CFTR \u201cpotentiators\u201d are used in a minority (~3% to 5%) of CF patients who harbor a G155D mutation in the CFTR gene.

In addition, the therapeutic and prognostic implication of these findings with respect to managing pancreatitis remains to be determined. Long-term follow-up of affected patients is needed. CFTR mutations are common in the general population. It is unclear whether the CFTR mutation alone can lead to pancreatitis as an autosomal recessive disease. A study evaluated 39 patients with idiopathic chronic pancreatitis to assess the risk associated with these mutations. Patients with two CFTR mutations (compound heterozygotes) demonstrated CFTR function at a level", "to elucidate the relationship between the genotype and pancreatic manifestations have been hampered by the number of mutations. The ability to detect CFTR mutations has led to the recognition that the clinical spectrum of the disease is broader than previously thought. Two studies have clarified the association between mutations of the CFTR gene and another monosymptomatic form of cystic fibrosis (i.e., chronic pancreatitis). It is estimated that in patients with idiopathic pancreatitis, the frequency of a single CFTR mutation is 11 times the expected frequency and the frequency of two mutant alleles is 80 times the expected frequency.

The normally negative intra-pleural pressure becomes positive, which depresses the ipsilat-eral hemidiaphragm and shifts the mediastinal structures into the contralateral chest.

The majority of reciprocal, apparently balanced translocations occur in phenotypically normal individuals. The risk for a clinical abnormality when a new reciprocal translocation is identified (usually during prenatal diagnostic studies) is about 7%. Analysis of cytogenetically reciprocal translocations using arrays has demonstrated that translocations in clinically normal individuals are more likely to show no deletions or duplications at the breakpoint, whereas translocations in clinically affected individuals are more likely to have breakpoint-associated deletions or", "their risk of having future afected ofspring?

Pregnancy losses resulting from de novo fetal aneuploidy, whether early and undocumented or documented through evaluation of chromosomal content in fetal tissues, cloud the results of many published studies. Their presence or absence must be documented in all investigations on recurrent pregnancy loss patients and their potential as a confounding factor discussed. The timing of fetal demise and tissue chromosomal analysis of any collected fetal tissues should be carefully weighed when diagnostic and therapeutic investigations into causes of recurrent pregnancy loss are being considered. Genetic Factors The most common inborn parental chromosomal abnormalities contributing to recurrent abortion are balanced translocations (11\u201314), in which one parent carries an overall normal gene content, but has", "individuals in the general population and result from the exchange of chromosomal segments between at least two chromosomes. These usually occur between nonhomologous chromosomes and can be identified based on an altered banding pattern on G-banding. Balanced translocation carriers are at risk for abnormal chromosome segregation during meiosis and therefore have a higher risk for infertility, SAB, and live-born offspring with multiple congenital malformations. These phenotypes are observed when only one of the pairs of chromosomes involved in a translocation is inherited from a parent, resulting in an unbalanced genotype (Fig. 83e-3). Sometimes the exchanged segments are so small that they cannot be appreciated by banding (cryptic translocation), and these are sometimes recognized 83e-5 when a phenotypically affected child with an unbalanced form is born.

In women \u226565 years, when bone density results are greater than the usual treatment thresholds noted above, a high level of bone resorption should prompt consideration of treatment.

In fact, clinical trials in which PTH hormone was administered to post-menopausal women with osteoporosis have shown significant increases in bone formation and bone mineral density.

This chapter focuses on these common findings and how they may direct the ongoing evaluation of the patient. APPROACH TO THE PATIENT: See also Chap. 147. As in all of medicine, obtaining a complete and thorough history is paramount in the evaluation of a patient with a possible infectious disease. The history is critical for developing a focused differential diagnosis and for guiding the physical exam and initial diagnostic testing. Although detailing all the elements of a history is beyond the scope of this chapter, specific components relevant to infectious diseases require particular attention. In general, these aspects focus on", "questions that draw out essential points. One should avoid suggesting terms to the patient, particularly those that prematurely confirm the physician\u2019s preconceived diagnoses (\u201cleading the witness\u201d). 2. The setting in which the illness occurred, its mode of onset and evolution, and its course are of major importance. One must attempt to learn precisely how each symptom began and progressed. Often the nature of the disease process can be decided from these data alone, such as the typical sudden onset of stroke. If such information cannot be supplied by the patient or his family, it may be necessary to judge the course of the illness by what the patient was able to do at different times (e.g., how far he could walk, when he could no longer negotiate stairs", "begin?\u201d and \u201cHow did it begin?,\u201d which will help in developing chronologic order in the patient\u2019s story. After the patient has furnished her spontaneous account (and before the next phase of the interview), it is useful to employ questions such as, \u201cWhat other problems have you noticed since you became ill?\u201d The response to this question may reveal other symptoms not yet brought forth in the interview. Thus, in the first phase of the interview, the physician obtains an account of the symptoms as the patient experiences them, without any bias being introduced by the examiner\u2019s direct questions. Information about the importance of the symptoms to the patient and the patient\u2019s emotional reaction to her symptoms are also revealed. 2. Because all available data regarding the symptoms are", "the physician is highly dependent on the cooperation of the patient for a reliable history, especially for a description of those symptoms that are unaccompanied by observable signs of disease. If the symptoms are in the sensory sphere, only the patient can tell what he sees, hears, or feels. The first step in the clinical encounter is to enlist the patient\u2019s trust and cooperation and make him realize the importance of the history and examination procedure. Of course, no matter how reliable the history appears to be, verification of the patient\u2019s account by a knowledgeable and objective informant is always desirable. When the patient\u2019s cooperation is not possible, as for example in a comatose or confused individual or in a young child, an attempt should be made to", "or other family member. We also find it useful to quiz the patient about cultural icons of the past that are appropriate to his age. Most patients should be able to name the recent presidents in reverse order. b. Recent past: Tell me about your recent illness (compare with previous statements). What is my name (or the nurse\u2019s name)? When did you see me for the first time? What tests were done yesterday? What were the headlines of the newspaper today? c. Memorization (learning): The patient is given three or four simple data (examiner\u2019s name, date, time of day, and a fruit, structure, or trait, such as honesty\u2014we use \u201ca red ball, Beacon street, and an envelope\u201d) and is asked to repeat them after a minute; or is", "clue is worth pursuing or should be dismissed as a \u201cred herring\u201d and weighing whether a proposed test, preventive measure, or treatment entails a greater risk than the disease itself are essential judgments that a skilled clinician must make many times each day. This combination of medical knowledge, intuition, experience, and judgment defines the art of medicine, which is as necessary to the practice of medicine as is a sound scientific base. CLINICAL SKILLS History-Taking The written history of an illness should include all the facts of medical significance in the life of the patient. Recent events should be given the most attention. Patients should, at some early point, have the opportunity to tell their own story of the illness without frequent interruption and, when appropriate, should receive", "next several chapters, they are discussed in Chaps. 47 to 49 at the end of the book, rather than here. The striking state in which a patient with previously intact mentality becomes confused is observed daily on the medical, surgical, and emergency wards of a general hospital. Occurring, as it often does, during an infection with fever or in the course of a toxic or metabolic disorder (such as renal or hepatic failure) or as an effect of medication, drugs, or alcohol, it never fails to create problems for the physician, nurses, and family. The physician has to cope with the problem of diagnosis, often without the advantage of a lucid history, and any program of therapy is constantly impeded by the patient\u2019s inattention, agitation, sleeplessness, and inability", "evaluated by determining how well the patient is able to provide a coherent chronologic history of his or her illness or personal events. Fund of information is assessed by asking questions about major historic or current events, with special attention to educational level and life experiences. Abnormalities of insight and judgment are usually detected during 2537 the patient interview; a more detailed assessment can be elicited by asking the patient to describe how he or she would respond to situations having a variety of potential outcomes (e.g., \u201cWhat would you do if you found a wallet on the sidewalk?\u201d). Abstract thought can be tested by asking the patient to describe similarities between various objects or concepts (e.g., apple and orange, desk and chair, poetry and sculpture) or to", "or expressing ideas. A more extensive examination of attention, memory, cognitive ability, and language is undertaken if the history or the manner in which it is given indicates the problem lies in those spheres. Otherwise, asking the date and place, repeating and recalling words, and simple arithmetic are adequate screening procedures. One then proceeds from an examination of the cranial nerves to the testing of motor, reflex, and sensory functions of the upper and lower limbs.

Physicians are challenged to practice the art of medicine in a manner that leads to effective alliances with their patients. The value of skilled medical history taking cannot be overemphasized. Physicians should listen carefully to what patients are saying about the nature and severity of their symptoms. They should listen to what patients may not be expressing: their fears, anxieties, and personal experiences that lead them to react in a certain manner when faced with what is often, to them, a crisis (such as the diagnosis of an abnormality on examination, laboratory testing, or pelvic imaging).

BIOLOGY OF LYMPHOID MALIGNANCIES: CONCEPTS OF THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION CLASSIFICATION OF LYMPHOID MALIGNANCIES The classification of lymphoid cancers evolved steadily throughout the twentieth century. The distinction between leukemia and lymphoma was made early, and separate classification systems were developed for each. Leukemias were first divided into acute and chronic subtypes based on average survival. Chronic leukemias were easily subdivided into those of lymphoid or myeloid origin based on morphologic characteristics. However, a spectrum of diseases that were formerly all called chronic lymphoid leukemia has become apparent (Table 134-1). The acute leukemias were usually malignancies of blast cells with few identifying characteristics. When cytochemical stains became available,", "of functionally incompetent lymphocytes that accumulate in the bone marrow, peripheral blood, lymph nodes, spleen, and liver. The most common type of leukemia. A rare form of T-cell CLL exists, but almost all cases involve well-differentiated B lymphocytes. The etiology is unknown, although there is some genetic contribution, as first-degree relatives of patients with CLL are three times more likely than others to develop a lymphoid malignancy. Primarily affects older adults (median age 65); the male-to-female ratio is 2:1. Often asymptomatic, but many patients present with fatigue, malaise, and infection. Common physical findings are lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. Diagnosed by the clinical picture; may be confirmed by f ow cytometry demonstrating the presence of CD5\u2014normally found only on T cells\u2014on leukemic cells with the characteristic B-cell antigens CD20 and", "a high WBC count B.

The few patients who present with the disease confined to lymph nodes have a high cure rate. MATURE (PERIPHERAL) B-CELL NEOPLASMS B-Cell Chronic Lymphoid Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma B-cell CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma represents the most common lymphoid leukemia, and when presenting as a lymphoma, it accounts for ~7% of non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas. Presentation can be as either leukemia or lymphoma. The major clinical characteristics of B-cell CLL/ small lymphocytic lymphoma are presented in Table 134-10. The diagnosis of typical B-cell CLL is made when an increased number of circulating lymphocytes (i.e., >4 \u00d7 109/L and usually Malignancies of Lymphoid Cells Abbreviation: MALT, mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. >10 \u00d7 109/L) is found (Fig. 134-6) that are monoclonal B cells expressing", "on the blood smear. Typical B-cell CLL is often found incidentally when a complete blood count is done for another reason. However, complaints that might lead to the diagnosis include fatigue, frequent infections, and new lymphadenopathy. The diagnosis of typical B-cell CLL should be considered in a patient presenting with an autoimmune hemolytic anemia or autoimmune thrombocytopenia. B-cell CLL has also been associated with red cell aplasia. When this disorder presents as lymphoma, the most common abnormality is asymptomatic lymphadenopathy, with or without splenomegaly. The staging systems predict prognosis in patients with typical B-cell CLL (Table 134-7). The evaluation of a new patient with typical B-cell CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma will include many of the studies (Table 134-11) that are used in patients with other non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphomas. In addition,", "ready to begin therapy. In ALL, prognosis is dependent on the genetic characteristics of the tumor, the patient\u2019s age, the white cell count, and the patient\u2019s overall clinical status and major organ function. In CLL, the patient evaluation should include a complete blood count, chemistry tests to measure major organ function, serum protein electrophoresis, and a bone marrow biopsy. However, some physicians believe that the diagnosis would not always require a bone marrow biopsy. Patients often have imaging studies of the chest and abdomen looking for pathologic lymphadenopathy. Patients with typical B-cell CLL can be subdivided into three major prognostic groups. Those patients with only blood and bone marrow involvement by leukemia but no lymphadenopathy, organomegaly, or signs of bone marrow failure have the best prognosis. Those with", "mandatory.

Patients typically have a high white cell count, splenomegaly, and minimal lymphadenopathy. The chances for a complete response to therapy are poor.

This procedure is thought to lead to subclinical activation of mast cells and basophils that have been sensitized with IgE against the drug, inducing them to gradually release their intracellular mediators at a rate that does not cause severe symptoms; eventually all of the cell-bound IgE is consumed by this process, leaving insufficient IgE available to cause an allergic reaction when subsequent therapeutic doses are administered.

In patients with a clinical history of allergic disease, allergists use the immediate response to help assess and confirm sensitization, and to determine which allergens are responsible. Minute amounts of potential allergens are introduced into the skin by a skin prick\u2014one site for each allergen\u2014and if the individual is sensitive to any of the allergens tested, a wheal-and-flare reaction will occur at the site within a few minutes (see Fig. 14.11, right panel). Although the reaction after the administration of such small amounts of allergen is usually very localized, there is a small risk of inducing anaphylaxis. Another standard test for allergy is to measure the circulating concentration of IgE antibody specific for a particular allergen in a sandwich ELISA (see Appendix I, Section", "AGEP, DIHS, SJS, or TEN.

The following three brief scenarios of a patient with hemoptysis demonstrate three distinct patterns: A 46-year-old man presents to his internist with a chief complaint of hemoptysis. An otherwise healthy nonsmoker, he is recovering from an apparent viral bronchitis. This presentation pattern suggests that the small amount of blood-streaked sputum is due to acute bronchitis, so that a chest x-ray provides sufficient reassurance that a more serious disorder is absent. In the second scenario, a 46-year-old patient who has the same chief complaint but with a 100-pack-year smoking history, a productive morning cough, and episodes of blood-streaked sputum fits the pattern of carcinoma of the lung.

The rate of decline in pulmonary function can be modified by changing environmental exposures (i.e., quitting smoking), with smoking cessation at an earlier age providing a more beneficial effect than smoking cessation after marked reductions in pulmonary function have already developed. Genetic factors likely contribute to the level of pulmonary function achieved during growth and to the rate of decline in response to smoking and potentially to other environmental factors as well. The three most common symptoms in COPD are cough, sputum production, and exertional dyspnea. Many patients have such symptoms for months or years before seeking medical attention.

All other current therapies are directed at improving symptoms and decreasing the frequency and severity of exacerbations. The institution of these therapies should involve an assessment of symptoms, potential risks, costs, and benefits of therapy. This should be followed by an assessment of response to therapy, and a decision should be made whether or not to continue treatment. PHARMACOTHERAPY Smoking Cessation (See also Chap. 470) It has been shown that middle-aged smokers who were able to successfully stop smoking experienced a significant improvement in the rate of decline in pulmonary function, returning to annual changes similar to that of nonsmoking patients.

Physical Examination A thorough gynecologic physical examination is typically performed at the time of the initial visit, on a yearly basis, and as needed throughout the course of treatment (Table 1.6). The extent of the physical examination during the gynecologic visit is often dictated by the patient\u2019s primary concerns and symptoms. For example, for healthy teens without symptoms who are requesting oral contraceptives before the initiation of intercourse, a gynecologic examination is not necessarily required.

Moreover, the likelihood of adverse outcome is augmented when levels of several markers are elevated (Dugof, 2005). Many of these complications are assumed to result from placental damage or dysfunction. However, the sensitivity and positive-predictive values of these markers are considered too low to be useful for screening or management. No speciic program of maternal or fetal surveillance has been found to favorably afect pregnancy outcomes (Dugof, 2010).

Currently, the only second-trimester multiple marker test widely used in the United States is the quadruple marker or \"quad\" screening test. It is performed from 15 to 21 weeks' gestation, and inclusive gestational age ranges vary according to individual laboratories. Pregnancies with fetal Down syndrome are characterized by lower maternal serum AFP, higher hCG, lower unconjugated estriol, and higher dimeric inhibin levels. When the quad screen was initially described, the Down syndrome detection rate approximated 70 percent. But, by the early 2000s, the reported detection rate in two large prospective trials had improved to 81 to 83 percent, with a 5-percent screen-positive rate (Malone, 2005b; Wald, 1996, 2003). The improved detection rate is attributable, at least in", "time of more than 7 days). For falling levels, a half-life of less than 1.4 days is rarely associated with an ectopic pregnancy, whereas a half-life of more than 7 days is most predictive of ectopic pregnancy. Serial hCG levels are usually required when the results of the initial ultrasonography examination are indeterminate (i.e., when there is no evidence of an intrauterine gestation or extrauterine cardiac activity consistent with an ectopic pregnancy). When the hCG level is less than 2,000, doubling time helps to predict viable intrauterine gestation (normal rise) versus nonviability (subnormal rise). With normally rising levels, a second ultrasonography examination is performed when the level is expected (by extrapolation) to reach 2,000 mIU/mL. Abnormally rising levels (less than 2,000 mIU/mL and less than 50% rise over", "rising levels, a second ultrasonography examination is performed when the level is expected (by extrapolation) to reach 2,000 mIU/mL. Abnormally rising levels (less than 2,000 mIU/mL and less than 50% rise over 48 hours) indicate a nonviable pregnancy. The location (i.e., intrauterine versus. extrauterine) must be determined surgically, either by laparoscopy or dilation and curettage. Indeterminate ultrasonography results and an hCG level of less than 2,000 mIU/mL is diagnostic of nonviable gestation, either ectopic pregnancy or a complete abortion. Rapidly falling hCG levels (50% over 48 hours) occur with a completed abortion, whereas with an ectopic pregnancy levels rise or plateau. A single hCG measurement has limited usefulness because there is considerable overlap of values between normal and abnormal pregnancies at a given gestational age. The ectopic pregnancy", "MTX. The best candidate for medical therapy is the woman who is asymptomatic, motivated, and compliant. With medical therapy, some classic predictors of success include a low initial serum 3-hCG level, small ectopic pregnancy size, and absent fetal cardiac activity. Of these, initial serum 3-hCG level is the single best prognostic indicator of successful treatment with single-dose MTX. Speciically, reported failure rates are 1.5 percent if the initial serum 3-hCG concentration is < 1000 mID/mL; 5.6 percent at 1000 to 2000 mID/mL; 3.8 percent at 2000 to 5000 mID/mL; and 14.3 percent when levels range between 5000 and 10,000 mID/mL (Menon, 2007).

Protein turnover Most proteins in the body are constantly being synthesized and then degraded (turned over), permitting the removal of abnormal or unneeded proteins. For many proteins, regulation of synthesis determines the concentration of protein in the cell, with protein degradation assuming a minor role. For other proteins, the rate of synthesis is constitutive (that is, essentially constant), and cellular levels of the protein are controlled by selective degradation. 1. Rate: In healthy adults, the total amount of protein in the body remains constant because the rate of protein synthesis is just sufficient to replace the protein that is degraded.

The presence of a subdural or epidural clot that is causing a shift of central brain structures calls for evacuation of the collection. The approach to these lesions has been discussed earlier.

The immediate prognosis for large and medium-sized cerebral clots is grave; some 30 to 35 percent of patients die in 1 to 30 days.

Between 5 and 10% of patients develop enough cerebral edema to cause obtundation or brain herniation. Edema peaks on the second or third day but can cause mass effect for ~10 days. The larger the infarct, the greater the likelihood that clinically significant edema will develop.

The natural trend is for the blood pressure to diminish over several days; therefore active treatment in the acute stages has been a matter of controversy.

Finally, before dismissing the symptom under study, inquire about other symptoms that might reasonably be expected under the clinical circumstances of the case. Symptoms specifically sought but denied are known as negative symptoms. These negative symptoms may confirm or rule out diagnostic possibilities suggested by the positive symptoms. 3. The data secured by the techniques described in the first two phases of the interview should now suggest several diagnostic", "the liver. Areas of tenderness should be evaluated after the examination of the rest of the abdomen. Table 1.5 Technique of Taking the History of the Present Illness 1. The technique used in taking the history of the present illness varies with the patient, the patient\u2019s problem, and the physician. Allow the patient to talk about her chief symptom. Although this symptom may or may not represent the real problem (depending on subsequent evaluation), it is usually uppermost in the patient\u2019s mind and most often constitutes the basis for the visit to the physician. During the phase of the interview, establish the temporal relation of the chief symptom to the total duration of the illness. Questions such as, \u201cThen up to the time of this symptom, you felt", "next several chapters, they are discussed in Chaps. 47 to 49 at the end of the book, rather than here. The striking state in which a patient with previously intact mentality becomes confused is observed daily on the medical, surgical, and emergency wards of a general hospital. Occurring, as it often does, during an infection with fever or in the course of a toxic or metabolic disorder (such as renal or hepatic failure) or as an effect of medication, drugs, or alcohol, it never fails to create problems for the physician, nurses, and family. The physician has to cope with the problem of diagnosis, often without the advantage of a lucid history, and any program of therapy is constantly impeded by the patient\u2019s inattention, agitation, sleeplessness, and inability", "associated with a high mortality rate because of the delay in recognition and treat-ment. Although there usually is a history of resisting vomiting, in a small number of patients, the injury occurs silently, without any antecedent history. When the chest radiogram of a patient with an esophageal perforation shows air or an effusion in the pleural space, the condition is often misdiagnosed as a pneumo-thorax or pancreatitis. An elevated pleural amylase caused by the extrusion of saliva through the perforation may fix the diag-nosis of pancreatitis in the mind of an unwary physician. If the chest radiogram is normal, a mistaken diagnosis of myocardial infarction or dissecting aneurysm is often made.Spontaneous rupture usually occurs into the left pleural cavity or just above the GEJ. About 50% of patients", "the patient is incoherent in describing the illness and the reasons for consulting a physician. Three categories of data are useful for the recognition and differential diagnosis of dementing brain disease: 1. A reliable history of the illness and its impact on daily life 2. Findings on mental examination 3. Ancillary examinations: CT, MRI, functional imaging, sometimes lumbar puncture, EEG, and appropriate laboratory procedures, as described in Chap. 2. The history should be supplemented by information obtained from a person other than the patient, because, through lack of insight, the patient will have limited and variable grasp of his illness or its gravity; indeed, he may be unaware even of his chief complaint. Special inquiry should be made about the patient\u2019s general behavior, capacity for work, personality changes,", "signs and symptoms of end-organ complications. Dx: Screen with the CAGE questionnaire. Monitor vital signs for evidence of withdrawal. Labs may reveal \u2191 LFTs, LDH, and MCV. Tx: Rule out medical complications; correct electrolyte abnormalities. Start a benzodiazepine taper for withdrawal symptoms. Add haloperidol for hallucinations and psychotic symptoms. Pinpoint pupils are not always a reliable sign of opioid ingestion because coingestions can lead to normal or enlarged pupils. Also look for a \u2193 respiratory rate, track marks, and \u2193breath sounds. CAGE questionnaire: 1. Have you ever felt the need to Cut down on your drinking? 2.

Special inquiry should be made about the patient\u2019s general behavior, capacity for work, personality changes, language, mood, special preoccupations and concerns, delusional ideas, hallucinatory experiences, personal habits and care in hygiene, and such faculties as memory and judgment. The examination of the mental status should include some of the following general categories with suggested examples for testing as modified for each patient\u2019s circumstances. In addition, the mode of answering and solving problems gives invaluable information about the mental operations of the subject and must be incorporated into any analysis of cognition. Many practitioners favor the formal assessment and scoring provided by the paper and pencil formalized testing of MMSE or MoCA", "absence of wheezing, asymmetry in the chest examination (suggesting large airway obstruction or pneumothorax mimicking an exacerbation), and the presence or absence of paradoxical motion of the abdominal wall. Patients with severe underlying COPD, who are in moderate or severe distress, or those with focal findings should have a chest x-ray. Approximately 25% of x-rays in this clinical situation will be abnormal, with the most frequent findings being pneumonia and congestive heart failure. Patients with advanced COPD, those with a history of hypercarbia, those with mental status changes (confusion, sleepiness), or those in significant distress should have an arterial blood-gas measurement. The presence of hypercarbia, defined as a PCO2 >45 mmHg, has important implications for treatment (discussed below).

Is the patient in pain or resting quietly, dyspneic or diaphoretic? Does the patient choose to avoid certain body positions to reduce or eliminate pain, as might be the case with suspected acute pericarditis? Are there clues indicating that dyspnea may have a pulmonary cause, such as a barrel chest deformity with an increased anterior-posterior diameter, tachypnea, and pursed-lip breathing? Skin pallor, cyanosis, and jaundice can be appreciated readily and provide additional clues. A chronically ill-appearing emaciated patient may suggest the presence of long-standing heart failure or another systemic disorder, such as a malignancy."]}, {"id": "seed_task_9999", "name": "MMLU_test_professionalmedicine", "is_classification": true, "instruction": "In this task, you are given a question and four different answer options.

In patients whose initially favorable response to sublingual nitroglycerin is followed by the return of chest discomfort, particularly if accompanied by other evidence of ongoing ischemia such as further ST-segment or T-wave shifts, the use of intravenous nitroglycerin should be considered. Therapy with nitrates should be avoided in patients who present with low systolic arterial pressure (<90 mmHg) or in whom there is clinical suspicion of RV infarction (inferior infarction on ECG, elevated jugular venous pressure, clear lungs, and hypo-tension). Nitrates should not be administered to patients who have taken a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor for erectile dysfunction within the preceding 24 h, because it may potentiate the hypotensive effects of nitrates.

The three drug groups traditionally used in angina (organic nitrates, calcium channel blockers, and \u03b2 blockers) decrease myocardial oxygen requirement by decreasing one or more of the major determinants of oxygen demand (heart size, heart rate, blood pressure, and contractility). In some patients, the nitrates and the calcium channel blockers may cause a redistribution of coronary flow FIGURE 12\u20132 Mechanism of action of nitrates, nitrites, and other substances that increase the concentration of nitric oxide (NO) in vascular smooth muscle cells.

The evaluating clinician should assess the quality, location (including radiation), and pattern (including onset and duration) of the pain as well as any provoking or alleviating factors. The presence of associated symptoms may also be useful in establishing a diagnosis. Quality of Pain The quality of chest discomfort alone is never sufficient to establish a diagnosis. However, the characteristics of the pain are pivotal in formulating an initial clinical impression and assessing the likelihood of a serious cardiopulmonary process (Table 19-1), including acs in particular (Fig. 19-2). Pressure or tightness is consistent with a typical presentation of myocardial ischemic pain. Nevertheless, the clinician must remember that some patients with ischemic chest symptoms deny any \u201cpain\u201d but rather complain of dyspnea or a vague", "predictor of fluid responsiveness (Fig. 321-3). Patients with fluid-responsive (i.e., hypovolemic) shock also may manifest large changes in pulse pressure as a function of respiration during mechanical ventilation (Fig. 321-4). A hypotensive patient with increased intravascular volume and cardiac dysfunction may have S3 and/or S4 gallops on examination, increased JVP, extremity edema, and crackles on lung auscultation. The chest x-ray may show cardiomegaly, widening of the vascular pedicle, Kerley B lines, and pulmonary edema. Chest pain and electrocardiographic changes consistent with ischemia may be noted (Chap. 326). In hypotensive patients with clinical evidence of increased cardiac output, a search for causes of decreased SVR is appropriate.

Check an ECG in the elderly and in patients with a history of cardiac disease. Treat with 100% O2 until asymptomatic and carboxyhemoglobin falls to normal levels. Use hyperbaric O2 for pregnant patients, nonresponders, those with signs of CNS or cardiac ischemia, or those with severely \u2191 carboxyhemoglobin to facilitate displacement of carbon monoxide from hemoglobin. Patients with airway burns or smoke inhalation may require early intubation, since upper airway edema can rapidly lead to complete obstruction. Table 2.17-3 outlines drug interactions and reactions that are commonly encountered in a clinical setting. Table 2.17-4 summarizes antidotes and treatments for substances commonly encountered in overdoses and intoxications. If a patient is unresponsive, it is common to empirically treat with a dose of Narcan.", "avoiding side effects such as headache and dizziness. Individual dose titration is important to prevent side effects. To minimize the effects of tolerance, the minimum effective dose should be used and a minimum of 8 h each day kept free of the drug to restore any useful response(s). \u03b2-Adrenergic Blockers These drugs represent an important component of the pharmacologic treatment of angina pectoris (Table 293-5). They reduce myocardial oxygen demand by inhibiting the increases in heart rate, arterial pressure, and myocardial contractility caused by adrenergic activation. Beta blockade reduces these variables most strikingly during exercise but causes only small reductions at rest. Long-acting beta-blocking drugs or sustained-release formulations offer the advantage of once-daily dosing (Table 293-5). The therapeutic aims include relief of angina and ischemia.

Dyspnea results primarily from elevation of the pulmonary capillary pressure caused by elevations of LV diastolic pressures secondary to impaired relaxation and reduced LV compliance. Angina pectoris usually develops somewhat later and reflects an imbalance between the augmented myocardial oxygen requirements and reduced oxygen availability. CAD may or may not be present, although its coexistence is common among AS patients older than age 65. Exertional syncope may result from a decline in arterial pressure caused by vasodilation in the exercising muscles and inadequate vasoconstriction in nonexercising muscles in the face of a fixed CO, or from a sudden fall in CO produced by an arrhythmia.

In mild mitral stenosis, the diastolic gradient across the valve is limited to the phases of rapid ventricular filling in early diastole and presystole. The rumble may occur during either or both periods. As the stenotic process becomes severe, a large pressure gradient exists across the valve during the entire diastolic filling period, and the rumble persists throughout diastole. As the left atrial pressure becomes greater, the interval between A2 (or P2) and the opening snap (O.S.) shortens. In severe mitral stenosis, secondary pulmonary hypertension develops and results in a loud P2 and the splitting interval usually narrows. ECG, electrocardiogram.
