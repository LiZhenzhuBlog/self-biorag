These two main strategies are known as K-selection (few offspring) and r-selection (many offspring). Which strategy is favoured by evolution depends on a variety of circumstances. Animals with few offspring can devote more resources to the nurturing and protection of each individual offspring, thus reducing the need for many offspring. On the other hand, animals with many offspring may devote fewer resources to each individual offspring; for these types of animals it is common for many offspring to die soon after birth, but enough individuals typically survive to maintain the population. ## Other types of reproductive strategies Polycyclic animals reproduce intermittently throughout their lives.

They are not consumed during the reaction. Enzyme molecules contain a special cleft called the active site, which contains amino acid side chains that participate in substrate binding and catalysis. The active site binds the substrate, forming an enzyme\u2013substrate (ES) complex. Binding is thought to cause a conformational change in the enzyme (induced fit) that allows catalysis.

Then the reaction achieves a steady-state kinetics in which enzyme substrate intermediates remains approximately constant over time and the reaction rate changes relatively slowly.
