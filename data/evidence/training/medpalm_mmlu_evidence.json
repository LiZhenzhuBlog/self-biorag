The Nature of Primary Metabolic Myopathies The chemical energy for muscle contraction is provided by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to adenosine diphosphate (ADP); ATP is restored by phosphocreatine and ADP acting in combination. These reactions are particularly important during brief, high-intensity exercise. During periods of prolonged muscle activity, rephosphorylation requires the availability of carbohydrates, fatty acids, and ketones, which are catabolized in mitochondria. Glycogen is the main sarcoplasmic source of carbohydrate, but blood glucose also moves freely in and out of muscle cells as needed during sustained exercise. The fatty acids in the blood, derived mainly from adipose tissue and intracellular lipid stores, constitute the other major source of energy.

The product is ADP (Adenosine diphosphate) and an inorganic phosphate, orthophosphate (Pi). ADP can be further hydrolyzed to give energy, AMP (Adenosine monophosphate), and another orthophosphate (Pi). ATP hydrolysis is the final link between the energy derived from food or sunlight and useful work such as muscle contraction, the establishment of ion gradients across membranes, and biosynthetic processes necessary to maintain life. Hydrolysis of the phosphate groups in ATP is especially exergonic, because the resulting orthophosphate group is greatly stabilized by multiple resonance structures, making the products (ADP and Pi)", "the transfer of their phosphate groups to ADP. In the citric acid cycle, one guanosine triphosphate (GTP) (which can donate a phosphate group to ADP or UDP, forming the respective triphosphates (a near equilibrium reaction catalyzed by nucleoside diphosphate kinase)) is produced by substrate-level phosphorylation (per cycle, with 2 cycles per glucose molecule) when succinyl-CoA synthetase converts succinyl-CoA to succinate. Substrate-level phosphorylation is also seen in working skeletal muscles and the brain. Phosphocreatine is stored as a readily available high-energy phosphate supply, and the enzyme creatine phosphokinase transfers a phosphate from phosphocreatine to ADP to produce ATP. Then the ATP releases giving chemical energy. An alternative way to create ATP is through oxidative phosphorylation, which takes place during the process of aerobic cellular respiration, in addition to the", "The presence of this energy buffer system keeps the ATP/ADP ratio high at subcellular places where ATP is needed, which ensures that the free energy of ATP remains high and minimizes the loss of adenosine nucleotides, which would cause cellular dysfunction. Such high-energy phosphate buffers in the form of phosphocreatine or phosphoarginine are known as phosphagens. In addition, due to the presence of subcompartmentalized Creatine Kinase Isoforms at specific sites of the cell, the phosphocreatine/creatine kinase system also acts as an intracellular energy transport system from those places where ATP is generated (mitochondria and glycolysis) to those places where energy is needed and used, e.g. at the myofibrils for muscle contraction, at the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) for calcium pumping and many more biological processes which depend on ATP.", "Fueling thought: Management of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in neuronal metabolism. Finally, why might neurons temporarily allow glycolysis to exceed oxphos in the face of acute energy demand? One speculation is that glycolysis, although it produces a lower yield of ATP than oxphos, provides a faster resupply of energy. Some evolutionary support for this speculation comes from muscle: fast-twitch muscle, requiring the greatest acute supply of energy, tends to be far more glycolytic and to have fewer mitochondria than the slow-twitch muscle used for postural control (;. Neurons possess many mitochondria and rely chronically on them as a major source of ATP, but perhaps, like fast-twitch muscle fibers, they use glycolysis together with the formidable and fast phosphocreatine/creatine kinase system to ensure prompt resupply of ATP. There is", "Energy transfer from adenosine triphosphate: quantitative analysis and mechanistic insights. The ATP-ADP thermodynamic cycle is the fundamental mode of energy exchange in oxidative phosphorylation, photophosphorylation, muscle contraction, and intracellular transport by various molecular motors and is therefore of vital importance in biological energy transduction and storage. Following a recent suggestion in the pages of this journal (Ross, J. J. Phys. Chem. B 2006, 110, 6987-6990), we have carried out a simple quantitative analysis of a direct molecular mechanism of energy transfer from adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The simulation provides new insights into the mechanistic events following terminal phosphorus-oxygen bond cleavage during ATP hydrolysis. This approach also allows for the division of the energy-transfer process into elementary steps and for the prediction of the distribution of the standard-state Gibbs free", "includes 22 +/- 8 max acceleration efforts. Human physiology relies on the energy stored in one of the phosphate bonds in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to power all activities. Breaking this bond changes ATP to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) which must then be converted back to ATP by one of the three main energy systems: phosphocreatine (ATP-Pcr), glycolytic, and aerobic. The cardiopulmonary system plays a key role in supplying the required energy resources and shuttling off by-products such as carbon dioxide, lactate and H+ ions. The following section briefly outlines some of the key considerations for the various energy systems.", "The creatine kinase system and pleiotropic effects of creatine. Although ATP represents the universal energy currency in all organisms and cells, ATP levels are not simply up-regulated in cells with high and/or intermittently fluctuating energy demand. Elevation of the intracellular ATP concentration [ATP], as an immediate energy reserve, followed by its hydrolysis, would lead to a massive accumulation of ADP plus Pi and also liberate H+, acidifying the cytosol. Since this would inhibit ATPases, such as the myofibrillar acto-myosin ATPase and consequently muscle contraction, and many other cellular processes, nature has evolved a means to deal with the problem of the immediate replenishment of ATP stores. The so-called phosphagens evolved as high-energy compounds that are \u201cmetabolically inert\u201d and as such do not interfere with primary metabolism. One of", "of recovery between muscle contractions. They note that the recovery period stalls reduction in metabolites, while at the same time giving the muscle enough time to restore metabolites such as phosphocreatine (PCr) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Appropriate choice of OFF times of stimulation are essential should these important metabolites be restored, facilitating further multiple contractions. In addition, it is important that duty cycles are chosen to minimized fatigue, that would also facilitate such contractions. In a rather straight-forward manner, it has been put forward by Moreno-Aranda and Seireg: In order to allow enough resting time for the muscle cells it is necessary to vary the duty cycle of the ON-OFF frequency.

Accessory expiratory muscles are the abdominal respiratory muscles (rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis, and external and internal obliques). They augment the passive recoil of the lungs during expiration and also help in inspiration. Their contraction cause lengthening of the diaphragm, thereby diminishing its radius of curvature, which helps in generating greater inspiratory pressure by the diaphragm.[] Dodd et al.[] postulated that abdominal muscle recruitment can store", "and provide some resistance, but when your physical therapist presses on the body part, the muscle is unable to maintain the contraction. 5/5. This means the muscle is functioning normally and is able to maintain its position even when maximum resistance is applied. so we admitted that will be some subjective, but in our opinion.", "reach the ends of the ribs. They are thicker than the Intercostales interni, and their fibers are directed obliquely downward and lateralward on the back of the thorax, and downward, forward, and medialward on the front. # Variations Continuation with the Obliquus externus or Serratus anterior: A Supracostalis muscle, from the anterior end of the first rib down to the second, third or fourth ribs occasionally occurs. # Additional images - A central rib of the left side.
