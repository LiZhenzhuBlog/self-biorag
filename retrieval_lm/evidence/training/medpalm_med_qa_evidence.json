Currently, the evidence is mixed on how much influence this muscle has on spine extension, lateral flexion, or rotation.\u00a0Even though the muscle has a broad attachment on the trunk and strong actions on the humerus, use of this muscle for surgical transposition appears to have limited effect on or restriction of normal function.", "regions of the back, immediately deep to the muscles in the superficial group (Fig. 2.47 and Table 2.2).

This positioning suggests a respiratory function, and at times, these muscles have been referred to as the respiratory group. Serratus posterior superior is deep to the rhomboid muscles, whereas serratus posterior inferior is deep to the latissimus dorsi.

Accessory expiratory muscles are the abdominal respiratory muscles (rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis, and external and internal obliques).
